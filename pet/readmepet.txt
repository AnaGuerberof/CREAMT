These are the files for PET.
PER are the files extracted from the tool translated or post-edited.
per2csv.csv contains the data extracted for the project using per2scv.py developed for the warbreaker project by Antonio Toral.
Outliers for PET are the lines not considered for the final calculation since translators left the segments inadvertenly opened.
