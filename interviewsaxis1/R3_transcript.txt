0:02.6 - 0:04.9	Interviewer: So we are recording now Hello.	
0:08.6 - 0:17.8	Interviewer: So I wanted to ask you if you could give me your your general views on reviewing these three texts.	
0:20.4 - 0:20.6	Interviewer: How	
0:20.7 - 0:23.8	Interviewer: Did you find doing a task.	
0:25.8 - 0:34.7	R3CA: Which which of the parts, the first one just just editing just like proofing or filling the Excels, because that's a completely different thing.	
0:39.1 - 0:40.4	Everything everything.	
0:41.5 - 0:48.5	R3CA: Everything, no, I mean it was really interesting and I have to, I have to admit that, at the beginning, I was a bit of afraid.	
0:49.6 - 1:05.4	R3CA: Just because I had seen all the the the amount of things that I had to do, and all the all the rows in the Excel files and everything and it was a bit like overwhelming, and when we spoke, the first time, and then you said why you're going to hate me and everything and.	
1:05.4 - 1:05.7	R3CA: It was.	
1:06.6 - 1:16.6	R3CA: I didn't know what i've you know what i've signed into I didn't know that it was this amount of work, but it was really enjoyable and it was long.	
1:17.3 - 1:28.4	R3CA: But it was it was really nice also I could see that that the task was different when I was faced with a very good text which, in my case I don't know we can talk about this.	
1:29.5 - 1:30.2	Interviewer: Yeh, sure, sure.	
1:30.4 - 1:45.2	R3CA: Text C was a very good text so so it was a real pleasure to review something which was so good, because well obviously also it has the little drawback that or setback that when something is so good.	
1:46.5 - 1:53.5	R3CA: Maybe then there is something that you don't really see because you know your idea is that a text is so good somebody there's something that you don't you know.	
1:54.7 - 2:03.0	R3CA: You have to read twice or something, but it was much better than, for example, reviewing text B I think yeah.	
2:03.3 - 2:10.7	R3CA: which was like full of things and some some of the words were crazy, I mean I remember, there was these sniper.	
2:11.1 - 2:29.9	R3CA: That in the translation was like if it was a sniper so it was a complete different thing right and and then you have to keep like taking things out and rewriting and then you knew that you had to translate all these work into the excel file and then it was cumbersome but.	
2:31.0 - 2:42.0	R3CA: But with A and especially C was was real good overall, it was nice it was nice because it's it's a way of seeing other you know how people think and.	
2:43.2 - 2:50.4	R3CA: And the mistakes of Maybe you can you can make, and everything, so it was good at the big getting us, as I say, it was like.	
2:50.8 - 3:01.9	R3CA: Oh, my God that's a lot of a lot of things that I have to do, but, but in the end it was Okay, and it was not as bad as I thought it would be when I was going to start.	
3:02.8 - 3:15.8	R3CA: It also helped to read like you said, I mean just first work on the on the words and then, once you have this task done, then you do it in the excel file, I still had to go back and forth.	
3:16.3 - 3:22.1	R3CA: Because I saw different things, and then I was feeling, something I said well yeah, but I think there was another mistake and so.	
3:23.4 - 3:32.8	R3CA: Sometimes it was like a kind of a yo yo or or table tennis kind of thing but, but it was nice on the whole, it was it was good.	
3:33.8 - 3:37.4	Interviewer: Did you review ABC in that order.	
3:38.2 - 3:38.7	Yes.	
3:39.9 - 3:40.1	R3CA: yeah.	
3:41.5 - 3:47.8	R3CA: yeah just because it was you know that that the name and it was yeah I follow that that order yeah.	
3:48.0 - 3:59.1	Interviewer: So what when you were reviewing apart from the Excels and also the Excels what were the main difficulties you think that you found them.	
4:00.2 - 4:05.7	Interviewer: The passages that you found more difficult.	
4:06.7 - 4:06.9	Oh.	
4:08.9 - 4:19.4	R3CA: I would say that, for me, the first thing because I read, I read the English text first, very quickly, I printed it out, because I think that.	
4:21.0 - 4:33.2	R3CA: Some things I see better when I have them on paper and First it was to get you know, to get a grasp of the story, because it was a bit strange and I didn't really I.	
4:33.7 - 4:50.3	R3CA: didn't quite like get it until the end know when you really realize the you know the magnitude, but I don't think there was a specific passage that was complicated.	
4:51.7 - 4:58.6	R3CA: But I did this weekend, so it is quite fresh I don't remember I wouldn't pinpoint any specific passage.	
4:59.2 - 5:04.6	Interviewer: But, would you say that what would you say were the difficulties of the text.	
5:06.3 - 5:08.0	R3CA: But linguistically you mean the word.	
5:08.0 - 5:08.8	R3CA: Yes or.	
5:14.5 - 5:25.0	R3CA: Well, obviously, as in any kind of literary text get the tone of you know, the "you", "tu", "usted", just to get the relationships right.	
5:25.7 - 5:43.3	R3CA: And then, how would they talk to each other if the guy worked in the hospital would to say "tÃº" to the painter but maybe they would say "usted" to the doctor and the doctor to the to the father would... so to establish the relationships to the relationship and then.	
5:44.8 - 5:53.8	R3CA: I don't know, maybe some of the things I wouldn't say that the language is very formal or very poetic but there were some...	
5:54.8 - 6:07.0	R3CA: Little things, maybe that had to be kept like that I don't know if it's because of the Catalan, I feel, sometimes I translate both into Spanish and Catalan but I, I sometimes have the feeling I don't know why.	
6:07.4 - 6:15.3	R3CA: That when you translate into Catalan you're being a little bit more academic than when you translate into Spanish I don't know if it's because.	
6:16.4 - 6:25.9	R3CA: To me it seems like Catalan has like more rules, but just because it needs a little bit more of protection and you are not as flexible.	
6:26.8 - 6:36.4	R3CA: When dealing with some linguistic kind of parts so that's why, for example in text C when I saw the way the translator had worked with a surname of the.	
6:37.1 - 6:48.1	R3CA: Of the of the woman Pelham norm, with the verb "pelar" which is like very informal but really gives the idea of that, and that was really, really surprising, so I would say.	
6:49.3 - 7:06.3	R3CA: I don't know just just that the the way that the relationships between the characters, so when do they how do they address, did they address to each other like with "usted" and then some of these kind of language, which was a little bit more poetic but I don't know, I will say that.	
7:06.5 - 7:19.6	Interviewer: What do you think of the play on words or the the title, for example, a or all the nicknames or the sobriquets for the...	
7:20.3 - 7:34.6	R3CA: Well, that was that was very nice and that's that's when I suspected that probably A and C well I don't know, are you will tell me I don't know I know for sure C was translated, you know, from scratch by a human translator.	
7:36.2 - 7:49.2	R3CA: B for sure it has to be machine translated, I don't know the degree of post editing there and A I would say, probably also done by a person... I don't know if you can give me the answer	
7:49.6 - 7:52.9	Interviewer: Right yes, I can give you, yes I think now I can give you.	
7:53.1 - 7:54.0	So.	
7:56.2 - 8:05.2	Interviewer: This project was translated by two translators, but the two translators translated into different modes.	
8:05.9 - 8:06.7	Interviewer: mm hmm the.	
8:06.9 - 8:19.5	Interviewer: First, one did the first part human, then post edited and the other one started post editing and then did human and I have.	
8:21.3 - 8:22.8	Interviewer: What you got.	
8:23.5 - 8:25.1	Interviewer: Your text A.	
8:25.1 - 8:28.1	Interviewer: Yes, it's a mixture of the two post editings.	
8:28.2 - 8:28.9	R3CA: Oh, really.	
8:29.6 - 8:31.0	Interviewer: And text C.	
8:31.0 - 8:37.0	Interviewer: yeah it's a mixture of the two human translators and text B	
8:37.1 - 8:39.0	Interviewer: Is all machine translation.	
8:39.2 - 8:39.6	All.	
8:41.4 - 8:45.6	Interviewer: Okay, does it surprise you that text B is all machine translation?	
8:45.7 - 8:47.4	R3CA: Yes, yes, because.	
8:48.6 - 8:54.3	R3CA: I mean obviously what when, then I changed a lot of things and in the in the Excel file, you can see that it's.	
8:54.3 - 8:55.0	R3CA: it's it's.	
8:55.0 - 8:56.0	R3CA: All filled out.	
8:57.2 - 9:09.7	R3CA: still some sentences were okay, so there were some sentences which was which were okay, but yeah obviously I thought that it was something like this because, while the names, the sobriquests were not not a translated.	
9:10.6 - 9:17.3	R3CA: At all so that's what I thought that well, at least, maybe a human, you know human translator could could have done.	
9:18.8 - 9:23.9	R3CA: You know, could have tried to give a name for these things because.	
9:25.2 - 9:30.4	R3CA: Some of them, some of them, I think that they give you the opportunity they give you the chance to be creative.	
9:31.7 - 9:40.9	R3CA: When... I mean to use the use the names and everything so yeah it surprises me a little bit because I thought that there was a little bit of post editing in text B.	
9:42.4 - 9:53.3	Interviewer: Nothing at all, but, as I mentioned a while we were talking before the interview the engine that we are using.	
9:53.7 - 9:57.1	Interviewer: is an engine that has been trained with literary texts.	
9:58.1 - 10:05.2	Interviewer: So it's not a general one, so I think, maybe some turn of phrases.	
10:05.7 - 10:08.0	Interviewer: are quite good, because they are.	
10:08.5 - 10:11.5	Interviewer: all from the literary domain okay.	
10:12.0 - 10:13.7	R3CA: Okay, then yeah then it makes sense.	
10:14.4 - 10:23.0	Interviewer: Did you notice any difference within the text A and C, did you notice that they were translated by two different people.	
10:23.3 - 10:26.8	R3CA: I thought that they were translated by two different people because.	
10:27.5 - 10:33.8	Interviewer: But I mean within the text or separately?	
10:34.2 - 10:48.1	R3CA: No, no, no separately, no I didn't I didn't tell the difference, really. I thought that someone had done text A, and then someone else did text C also the text C was so good, and I don't know if the tone everything I mean the.	
10:49.5 - 11:03.2	R3CA: You know that it had a different kind of flow, so I thought that that they they had been translated by two different people, but like they had done a complete text one not not a mixture of things that that's really surprising really.	
11:04.0 - 11:09.6	Interviewer: yeah so what I like about this experiment, we can talk about that.	
11:11.2 - 11:18.3	Interviewer: But obviously I think if you're told text A and text B which are relatively short.	
11:18.4 - 11:19.1	R3CA: You are.	
11:19.4 - 11:28.1	Interviewer: it's difficult to imagine that is a different translator right so maybe if I tell you, then you would notice.	
11:28.2 - 11:29.2	R3CA: yeah yeah.	
11:29.2 - 11:30.8	R3CA: Probably probably.	
11:31.3 - 11:41.0	Interviewer: So you mentioned earlier, you mentioned something about the translators being creative that they were you said, the text.	
11:42.4 - 11:58.7	Interviewer: You know, presented parts why they have to be creative So where do you think the translators had to be creative in this text and what do you think is to be creative in literary translation.	
12:00.6 - 12:10.6	R3CA: Well, obviously the parts in which you need creativity were the title and also because it was explained inside the text so that had to be some coherence there.	
12:11.2 - 12:25.0	R3CA: And you really had to think how to do it, because then there was the sentence explaining how you got to the to the to the name right because you pronounce O like No or something so you really have to adapt that.	
12:26.6 - 12:34.4	R3CA: Then, obviously the names of the of the names, they give to this system or whatever and.	
12:35.8 - 12:40.9	R3CA: The play the play on words with the surname of the woman and the activity, she does.	
12:41.7 - 12:51.3	R3CA: which has to be not very obvious because he doesn't really get it when the painter says oh that's very appropriate, because if you do that it's done can whatever and you so you're dunk people.	
12:51.6 - 13:07.0	R3CA: And she's like a little bit lost, so it doesn't it didn't really have to be very, very obvious so that's also something that had to be very creative and the rest of it stays the same and what it used to be really for me.	
13:08.1 - 13:14.3	R3CA: And I think it's something that we mentioned in the emails for me it's when you really have to modify things right, I mean when.	
13:14.7 - 13:25.5	R3CA: You really have to take these things and bring it to your domain and to your to your language to your knowledge to your culture, so that that would be being creative like really.	
13:26.9 - 13:43.8	R3CA: not a distance a lot from the text, but really having this freedom to change things to change the text, so it really makes the same impression to the to the reader to to keep the feelings that would have the.	
13:45.6 - 13:53.0	R3CA: the reader of the of the source text and the reader of the translated text I don't know if that really makes sense.	
13:55.7 - 14:07.0	Interviewer: Sure, it does. And when you were doing the annotating the reproductions and they you know when you there were the units of creative potential that we selected and you had to classify.	
14:08.2 - 14:11.0	Interviewer: How did you find that what was that.	
14:12.7 - 14:15.5	Interviewer: Do you think we had selected the proper.	
14:17.4 - 14:19.4	Interviewer: Units of creative potential.	
14:20.8 - 14:30.2	R3CA: For me, it was very difficult at the beginning to really and it was really well explained in your instructions, but it was it was at the beginning was difficult to differentiate between.	
14:31.1 - 14:38.8	R3CA: When you said reproduction and direct translation, because you said that it's not the way someone who is not who	
14:39.3 - 14:50.0	R3CA: doesn't belong to the field is not the way that they would understand the literal translation, but, at the beginning it was different because it was difficult because there were some sentences which were Okay, even in Text C.	
14:52.2 - 14:58.5	R3CA: They were nice, but obviously they would just direct translation, because some sentences you don't really need to.	
14:59.7 - 15:15.2	R3CA: Like change a lot right and that that at the beginning, it took some effort, because it's like okay now just think it's literal but not literally in a bad way, because I think that as translations as translators, we always think that something literally something bad, but.	
15:16.7 - 15:32.8	R3CA: In this case it wasn't I mean it just that they were reproduction and that's Okay, then, for me, what was difficult, and I think something that I, that I asked you through mail is in the in the field of the modifications, because there was cultural and situational and.	
15:34.1 - 15:34.7	Interviewer: And historical.	
15:34.8 - 15:42.4	R3CA: yeah and for me there and the way I work that through in the end it was I put it was situational when.	
15:43.9 - 15:58.4	R3CA: It fit the situation, and it was cultural when it was, for example, a word or something that we would expect linguistically there, for example, when it was like Gee and then you had Ostras, then I put that as cultural because it.	
15:58.4 - 15:59.1	Interviewer: was like.	
16:00.1 - 16:12.4	R3CA: More linguistic let's say, but if it was another kind of modification, but maybe it was not a standard or it was not a set phrase, or it was well just the situation I put a put situational.	
16:12.8 - 16:19.4	R3CA: But I really had to do this kind of mental exercise to say okay when it's something like cultural... lexical.	
16:20.1 - 16:35.3	R3CA: And, unlike that you will put cultural and then you would put the other one, and that was a That was a bit complicated at first to get around the idea that text and then put it, putting it into you know into the Excels and everything.	
16:36.2 - 16:43.3	Interviewer: yeah because this is not what we are used to do I think sometimes I also think.	
16:43.8 - 16:45.9	Interviewer: You know what do I mean by.	
16:47.6 - 16:59.3	Interviewer: By now, I have an understanding because i've been dealing with this for a while and would you say that you're satisfied with the review that that that you did.	
17:00.0 - 17:07.3	R3CA: I think so I mean it's it's difficult because it's not something I was really comfortable with because it's not.	
17:07.8 - 17:15.9	R3CA: Usually the work, the work I do, and the way I work with my customers and everything they don't ask me to to do these kind of things.	
17:16.3 - 17:26.8	R3CA: and luckily I don't work with these agencies that you know they give you these detailed reports and they say your translation has been failed or whatever so.	
17:27.4 - 17:33.0	R3CA: Luckily, because you know I would get like a little bit anxious with all this information and and and so many things right.	
17:33.4 - 17:45.8	R3CA: So um yeah I get that if you work with multinationals or big big agencies, maybe you're more used to dealing with these sort of lingo and this sort of codes for everything.	
17:46.9 - 17:54.3	R3CA: I think that I did a good good job as far as I know I just did it in the best way I could, and I knew so.	
17:55.3 - 17:56.5	R3CA: I would say, I am satisfied.	
17:58.0 - 17:59.0	R3CA: I hope it is all right.	
17:59.0 - 18:15.3	R3CA: I know that it's very...as you said in the emails... that sometimes it's the way you feel or the way you you think right?, probably for me, this would be reproduction... a direct translation and for someone would be a reproduction and something else so.	
18:15.9 - 18:17.4	R3CA: I don't know that depends a little bit.	
18:17.5 - 18:17.9	R3CA: But I.	
18:18.2 - 18:25.0	Interviewer: think that will be different, but maybe everyone agrees, in which of the text was more creative.	
18:26.0 - 18:28.1	R3CA: Well, hopefully yeah no but for for me.	
18:28.1 - 18:35.2	R3CA: It was C hands hands down but...	
18:35.3 - 18:51.1	Interviewer: yeah I wanted you to talk to me a little bit... I think you have mentioned some of the things of why you prefer C but could, could you explain, for example, between A and C why did you prefer C one what were the little things that make you like it more?	
18:51.2 - 19:00.7	R3CA: Okay, for me, because well basically the title CON0C was the same it was expressed maybe now that there were there was a tiny difference so that's okay.	
19:01.2 - 19:20.9	R3CA: But I really liked for me what really, what was the play on words with the surname of of that of the woman other they say Pelham and then "fer pelar" for me that was great because I was, I was reading it, it was like "oh yeah" that that that's because when I read A.	
19:22.4 - 19:26.1	R3CA: You know that the play on words was totally lost because.	
19:27.5 - 19:32.5	R3CA: It was like wow now I don't remember what it wasn't like a little bit literal.	
19:33.4 - 19:46.6	R3CA: And then you know that that gets you thinking, and it was how would I say that, and I was like musing on that I was I had that you know the background like thinking, and when I got to text C and I read that it was like it's perfect.	
19:47.0 - 20:03.7	R3CA: So I would say that that that was I don't know if it was the point that it was the the the thing, but if not, it was one of the of the key factors that make me love C the most I don't know in general, I thought it was very, very good.	
20:05.1 - 20:07.1	R3CA: But yeah but, but especially for these.	
20:07.4 - 20:12.2	R3CA: Little things but yeah yeah let's say the surname basically it was the.	
20:12.6 - 20:13.6	R3CA: best thing, it was a very.	
20:13.6 - 20:15.9	Interviewer: The play on words with the surname.	
20:16.0 - 20:16.7	R3CA: yeah yeah.	
20:17.6 - 20:25.8	Interviewer: yeah and so you did you guess that text B had some kind of machine.	
20:25.9 - 20:26.5	In it.	
20:29.0 - 20:29.5	R3CA: i'm sorry.	
20:30.2 - 20:35.3	Interviewer: Did you guess when you were reviewing that text be was machine translation.	
20:36.4 - 20:42.7	R3CA: yeah because there were some incoherences I think inside the same text.	
20:43.7 - 20:53.7	R3CA: I don't remember now properly, but I think that, for example, yeah that the sobriquets.... the names of the Center whatever so, for example, the beginning, they said it was happy hooligan.	
20:54.4 - 21:01.0	R3CA: And then, they say Hooligan feliÃ§ or something like these, so there was this kind of inconsistencies.	
21:02.0 - 21:19.3	R3CA: but also because there were many things which were not translated so that made me think that probably was that because I mean i've used i've done, not a lot but i've done some post-editing and and usually what happens is that some words have not translated and.	
21:20.9 - 21:30.2	R3CA: And in this case, for example, sobriquet I think it was the same, and then triplets, which is a word which should be I mean obviously you don't talk about "trigenims" every day but.	
21:30.4 - 21:38.4	R3CA: You look that up in the dictionary so triplets was kept the same it was not translated, so these things just made me think that probably that.	
21:39.8 - 21:46.7	R3CA: says, the Internet is unstable, so that those were like little indicators that I saw that it was.	
21:47.5 - 21:49.2	Interviewer: You mentioned that.	
21:49.2 - 21:50.7	R3CA: What I didn't know it, you.	
21:52.0 - 21:58.3	Interviewer: No, I think you were going to say that that it wasn't you thought there was some editing, right?	
21:58.3 - 22:05.3	R3CA: Yeah yeah yeah maybe like very, very quick, because obviously some of the things probably yeah human it's true that that.	
22:06.0 - 22:13.3	R3CA: A human translator would have would have seen that i'm probably would have edited something out or just change something but um.	
22:14.0 - 22:29.7	R3CA: But yeah yeah That was really surprising because some of the sentences didn't really look like if they had been just just machine translated and and never touched, but um but yeah yeah basically these things things that were not translated these inconsistencies.	
22:31.3 - 22:34.4	R3CA: Inside the text and.	
22:35.8 - 22:43.5	R3CA: I don't know basically these. What I understand I don't know if you can, if you can give me the answer to that is why in text A.	
22:44.9 - 22:49.1	R3CA: translator well whoever decided to translate the name to Afflick.	
22:50.3 - 23:08.2	R3CA: Because if I didn't really see the reason the reasoning behind that and that's what I thought that maybe A had been machine translated, but then like had been... you know, like underwent a really or undergone a really big was translate a post-editing thing.	
23:08.6 - 23:13.7	Interviewer: This is one of the translator translated all the names.	
23:14.8 - 23:17.2	Interviewer: So Pelham and Aflick and Hitz.	
23:19.3 - 23:21.1	Interviewer: In the original English.	
23:22.4 - 23:26.3	Interviewer: They have they appear to have a connotation.	
23:26.4 - 23:28.1	Interviewer: Okay Duncan.	
23:28.7 - 23:31.9	Interviewer: Duncan is a common name in English, but to.	
23:32.1 - 23:33.9	Interviewer: to play with their work to dunk.	
23:34.4 - 23:35.0	Interviewer: And then.	
23:35.1 - 23:39.9	Interviewer: Whailing it has the thing of wailing have somebody in sorrow.	
23:40.3 - 23:40.4	Interviewer: The.	
23:40.5 - 23:42.0	R3CA: And Afflick "de aflicciÃ³".	
23:42.3 - 23:43.3	R3CA: yeah definitely.	
23:44.1 - 23:45.6	Interviewer: Okay yeah most.	
23:46.1 - 23:53.5	Interviewer: The person had... this translator had translated all the surnames, but when I have to divide.	
23:53.6 - 23:54.0	R3CA: Okay.	
23:54.3 - 23:55.9	Interviewer: I had to make some Salomonic.	
23:55.9 - 23:57.2	R3CA: Decisions mm hmm.	
23:58.2 - 24:01.9	Interviewer: So I didn't want to interfere so much in the translation.	
24:01.9 - 24:02.4	Okay.	
24:03.7 - 24:08.6	Interviewer: And the part that was one part with the surname appear more.	
24:09.0 - 24:09.4	R3CA: mm hmm.	
24:09.8 - 24:19.1	Interviewer: So I had to leave it and then change it in the second part and i'm vice versa, so that was a bit.	
24:19.6 - 24:26.6	Interviewer: A pity but it is part of the project, for example, I didn't have this problem in Dutch.	
24:26.7 - 24:31.9	Interviewer: Because they didn't translate any of the names, so it was much easier to put them together.	
24:32.3 - 24:33.6	R3CA: mm hmm all right.	
24:33.7 - 24:34.7	Interviewer: You know, but.	
24:35.1 - 24:35.7	Interviewer: I think.	
24:36.8 - 24:40.9	Interviewer: I think, although I understand that a.	
24:41.7 - 24:44.6	Interviewer: Surnames are no usually translated.	
24:45.1 - 24:57.9	Interviewer: I think these surnames require some thinking, and I also thought that they because I translated this into Spanish and I translated the surnames.	
24:58.3 - 25:00.1	Interviewer: I did this for me for.	
25:01.4 - 25:04.4	Interviewer: To just get familiar with the text.	
25:05.5 - 25:13.3	Interviewer: But I love that solution of not translating it, but making it sound like a word.	
25:14.3 - 25:23.0	R3CA: For me, the things that I thought about that, and I said okay Afflick and I, and I thought, well, maybe it's affliction but for me when I when I just thought about that.	
25:24.6 - 25:37.2	R3CA: Maybe it just me and maybe another reader would really, you know, like connect the points and connect the dots but um it was like I don't really know if all the readers will get the meaning of these Afflick.	
25:37.9 - 25:46.1	R3CA: For me, it was this like yeah I get after thinking it through Okay, I can see Afflick affliction i afligir i afligit.	
25:47.1 - 26:00.4	R3CA: But I don't know Maybe it was because of you know, it was like written as if, as if it was a surname which is okay, because it has to be, it has to give the idea has to give some veracity right, so it was Okay, but um.	
26:01.1 - 26:11.6	R3CA: I don't know I thought that maybe this change, I wasn't really sure that a reader would connect it right would think I don't know that it was related to that.	
26:11.9 - 26:12.3	R3CA: Well, they.	
26:12.4 - 26:17.2	Interviewer: Well maybe they won't notice or but.	
26:17.3 - 26:20.2	Interviewer: If all is translated maybe.	
26:20.7 - 26:23.3	Interviewer: Or if there is some explanation... a note.	
26:24.8 - 26:30.4	Interviewer: Is that translate just suggested, I mean this is usually discuss with the editors.	
26:31.4 - 26:32.7	Interviewer: But here we saw.	
26:34.0 - 26:34.4	R3CA: yeah.	
26:34.4 - 26:36.1	Interviewer: So I think that issue was part.	
26:36.8 - 26:38.9	Interviewer: Part of the way the experiment is run.	
26:39.0 - 26:40.3	Interviewer: Unfortunately.	
26:40.7 - 26:42.4	R3CA: No, no, so it's nice to know that.	
26:42.7 - 26:44.1	Interviewer: yeah it's Nice.	
26:45.0 - 26:49.0	R3CA: to know that the inner workings of the text and everything.	
26:50.8 - 26:55.0	Interviewer: And so, in your opinion.	
26:55.4 - 27:02.3	Interviewer: You know you have seen three texts what do you think is the impact.	
27:04.6 - 27:09.2	Interviewer: of MT in the translators' creativity.	
27:10.4 - 27:21.2	R3CA: that's my personal opinion, and the things that i've seen when when I thought it would have worked on on on this post-editing for me, I think that at the beginning.	
27:22.3 - 27:23.0	R3CA: It really.	
27:25.1 - 27:30.3	R3CA: It makes things a little bit difficult it's like when you are post-editing something.	
27:31.4 - 27:34.6	R3CA: You have like a "corset" you have something.	
27:36.6 - 27:49.0	R3CA: I don't know it's difficult it's difficult to to to say, but I think I said something on Twitter, the other day was like some time ago, a month ago, like, for me, when when i'm post editing, I feel that.	
27:50.3 - 28:02.0	R3CA: i'm being a little bit more literal than if I did, that from scratch and I realized that when i'm just checking at the end, I mean if maybe I do a double check or I just.	
28:03.0 - 28:18.0	R3CA: Leave it for some time and then go over the text again then maybe i'm able to be a little bit more flexible, but, at the beginning, if it just the first a stage of post-editing it is very difficult for me to be creative and to.	
28:19.6 - 28:29.0	R3CA: detach a little bit more from the text I need some time and some distance to then read it again, maybe with fresh eyes or whatever and and find.	
28:29.6 - 28:41.2	R3CA: The way to you know fly and just do more things but, at the beginning, for me, is these I mean I feel like maybe tempted, because in a way it's like you're correcting something so.	
28:42.7 - 28:48.3	R3CA: For me it's more difficult to be creative if i'm doing a post-editing if i'm post-editing something.	
28:49.4 - 28:56.6	Interviewer: And what do you think is the impact on the reader because say, for example, the readers.	
28:58.1 - 29:08.3	Interviewer: will have if they experienced different types of texts some human translated some post-edited and some raw MT.	
29:09.4 - 29:14.3	Interviewer: What do you think the reading experience would be for this three different texts.	
29:15.6 - 29:19.6	R3CA: I will say that, basically, the difference, would be the literality right that that may be.	
29:20.7 - 29:27.6	R3CA: a post-edited text would be more literal than than other kinds of texts I would say.	
29:27.8 - 29:30.6	Interviewer: But for the reader of literature.	
29:31.0 - 29:35.1	Interviewer: How do you think they are going to receive this different texts.	
29:35.6 - 29:36.8	R3CA: Without knowing?	
29:37.0 - 29:42.2	Interviewer: Without knowing... how do you think the impact on them can be.	
29:45.9 - 29:49.1	R3CA: I don't know... just that... that they will feel that maybe it's.	
29:50.0 - 29:57.5	R3CA: A more literal translation, maybe they would see that it's more you know sentence after sentence that maybe is not going to be like a real.	
29:58.0 - 30:05.7	R3CA: cohesive kind of thing I don't know I guess it depends, as you said, on the machine and also it depends on the on the person working on the text after that.	
30:05.8 - 30:08.3	Interviewer: But on these three particular texts.	
30:08.5 - 30:22.2	Interviewer: If we give these three texts to readers we don't tell them where they... who did them and we asked them to read this text only in Catalan, what do you think the reading experience would be.	
30:22.4 - 30:23.6	R3CA: Well, very bad for B.	
30:25.9 - 30:36.2	R3CA: Well, and well i'm just i'm really i'm just thinking again on on what you said that A and C where it has done by people and and I had a completely different idea.	
30:37.3 - 30:51.2	R3CA: On my mind um I would say that the reader, for example, if for text B would be like what would would be lost on on many things are many words and probably the the experience would not be a satisfactory is you know with with the.	
30:51.7 - 30:58.8	R3CA: If you compare it to the other kind of texts, for example, know the names, we were saying the names of of that like go easy or.	
30:59.8 - 31:12.7	R3CA: I don't know Goodbye mom or whatever, and on and these kind of things you would miss a little bit the creativity and probably people would complain because would not be like really, really good or up to standard.	
31:13.8 - 31:15.0	R3CA: And the rest, I don't know if.	
31:17.1 - 31:23.6	R3CA: I don't really know because some people really maybe they read something which is not very, very well translated and they are happy.	
31:23.9 - 31:41.3	R3CA: And there are people who read something which is really well translated and, as we said no?, we change the surnames and and they like it, and some would say that that's just maybe too much, so I would say, would depend on the reader but, in general, I would say that they would complain.	
31:43.0 - 31:45.4	R3CA: For B and they would not understand.	
31:46.5 - 31:52.9	R3CA: The whole maybe story they wouldn't get a satisfactory text that would say no, they wouldn't get the.	
31:53.0 - 31:54.7	Interviewer: And between A and C.	
31:58.3 - 32:00.2	R3CA: A would be just regular.	
32:01.3 - 32:13.8	R3CA: translation it's okay that are just some things and maybe you the like I don't think that they would complain for that for me well, as I said, I mean C was was the best and.	
32:14.6 - 32:28.8	R3CA: Also because I don't know if it's it's different because we are trained and we know about this text and and we have more we maybe I don't know we have seen more things and we realize things that maybe a regular reader wouldn't.	
32:29.8 - 32:47.8	R3CA: So I don't really know my mom, for example, she reads a lot, and she reads lots of translations and something see he says, are these texts was a little bit, but on the whole she's Okay, I mean she reads everything and probably she's read very good translations and and well.	
32:49.0 - 33:03.0	R3CA: Translations which were not that that good and and for her it was okay right.. so I don't know, I guess, maybe it also depends on the on the mistakes that you find or this these kind of things.	
33:03.8 - 33:09.3	Interviewer: You said earlier that you had a completely different idea on your mind of.	
33:10.7 - 33:12.0	Interviewer: A and C.	
33:12.2 - 33:13.7	Interviewer: What what's your idea.	
33:16.2 - 33:24.2	R3CA: I thought that maybe A was machine translated, but had really been or had been heavily post-edited.	
33:24.7 - 33:29.9	Interviewer: yeah that's true, it was machine translation post edited.	
33:30.3 - 33:30.9	A.	
33:33.1 - 33:35.3	Interviewer: But two different people.	
33:36.0 - 33:38.8	R3CA: But different people. But C you said that it, it was also machine translated and post-edited.	
33:38.8 - 33:39.8	Interviewer: No.	
33:39.9 - 33:43.1	R3CA: Ah, no, no from scratch yeah so so that that's a little bit.	
33:44.8 - 33:46.2	Interviewer: C.	
33:47.4 - 33:51.3	Interviewer: Is the same translators, but let's say free.	
33:51.3 - 33:53.6	R3CA: Free okay yeah.	
33:53.9 - 33:55.3	Interviewer: Without any aid.	
33:55.6 - 33:57.7	R3CA: mm hmm but how.	
33:58.0 - 34:00.6	Interviewer: So, is this the idea that you had in your mind?	
34:00.7 - 34:02.7	R3CA: yeah more or less yeah.	
34:03.8 - 34:08.4	R3CA: I was mistaken about B being maybe post-edited a little bit.	
34:08.8 - 34:11.1	Interviewer: yeah which wasn't.	
34:11.4 - 34:21.8	R3CA: yeah which wasn't but the rest yeah because I I saw differences between A and C, probably because well, as I said, know some of the translation of the surnames and.	
34:23.3 - 34:34.6	R3CA: Some of the of the C really had another I think of that and not just the names some sentences were really natural and I think I gave lots of kudos to.	
34:35.3 - 34:46.2	R3CA: C in that aspect, because there were some sentences which I said wow that that's very good and that's very Catalan and that's very nice and it's something that A didn't have.	
34:47.8 - 34:51.0	R3CA: didn't have so many local expressions or.	
34:52.0 - 34:52.6	R3CA: I don't know.	
34:54.2 - 34:59.2	R3CA: I don't know these kind of things that not just play on words but some sentences that you said wow that's that's really good I mean.	
34:59.5 - 35:10.6	R3CA: i'm really thinking well that that was that was a really nice solution, something that maybe I could just take note of just to for my translations, because it was it was really, really good yeah.	
35:11.1 - 35:15.9	Interviewer: They I think the difference is that they were the same translators, but.	
35:15.9 - 35:20.0	Interviewer: In different modalities that's when it's maybe surprising for you.	
35:20.2 - 35:27.4	R3CA: huh yeah yeah I didn't know that that the two same people had worked on, you know, on that for sure.	
35:27.5 - 35:29.6	Interviewer: I thought that you know.	
35:29.7 - 35:35.3	R3CA: That it was just one for A and one for C and then machine B and someone had retouched.	
35:36.1 - 35:37.4	R3CA: or whatever.	
35:37.5 - 35:41.9	Interviewer: So as a translator if you could.	
35:44.0 - 35:44.2	Interviewer: Ask.	
35:44.7 - 35:46.8	Interviewer: Or if you had a magic wand.	
35:47.2 - 35:48.4	Interviewer: What do you think.	
35:48.7 - 35:53.5	Interviewer: machine translation technology or technology.	
35:53.7 - 35:54.9	Interviewer: should have.	
35:56.9 - 35:57.8	Interviewer: and	
35:58.8 - 36:04.6	Interviewer: What would you like to have in MT technology or technology as a translator.	
36:05.3 - 36:07.0	R3CA: So what kind of aid you mean.	
36:07.4 - 36:07.7	Interviewer: yeah.	
36:07.8 - 36:11.3	Interviewer: I know what How would you like it to be.	
36:12.5 - 36:12.8	R3CA: hmm.	
36:13.8 - 36:15.3	R3CA: I don't know the thing is not.	
36:17.2 - 36:23.4	R3CA: Ah, I see it, a little bit far from you know from.	
36:25.1 - 36:37.0	R3CA: producing very high quality tech So for me right now, when I do post-editing, as I said, I don't really feel that free so.	
36:38.8 - 36:50.6	R3CA: I wouldn't use it right now what obviously depends on the on the on the engine...if the engine is very good and the corpus and whatever that you feed the machine with is very good, then, then you probably you think twice, but.	
36:51.8 - 36:57.2	R3CA: What could have I don't know, I would ask more naturalaty	
36:59.3 - 37:02.0	R3CA: That had like lots of.	
37:03.5 - 37:08.0	R3CA: But it's really difficult because, when someone writes a text literally text.	
37:10.0 - 37:26.4	R3CA: You can't ... you can't expect that person to to like use lots of expression, so I don't know if I know it's very difficult to say if to have a good database of expressions natural equivalents but how did you get that right, I mean.	
37:26.9 - 37:28.4	Interviewer: When we can only ask.	
37:30.9 - 37:32.8	R3CA: Other know I would have to think about the one.	
37:33.2 - 37:34.9	R3CA: Just like from that I don't know.	
37:36.3 - 37:44.9	Interviewer: To make your work better or more creative for which you want to have in technology.	
37:46.3 - 37:49.6	R3CA: The things that either know what technology can do for me right.	
37:49.6 - 37:50.9	Interviewer: I mean I don't know that's what I.	
37:52.0 - 37:53.9	Interviewer: that's what we can dream here.	
37:54.0 - 37:59.6	R3CA: Yes, yeah that was yeah that that's that's for free at the moment um I don't know.	
38:00.8 - 38:10.1	R3CA: Maybe equivalents for everything that you could be that maybe you could be like able to choose.	
38:10.7 - 38:18.6	R3CA: Between like lots of options when you're translating something that detects when you're being maybe too literal.	
38:19.4 - 38:26.9	R3CA: Maybe that could be one like careful with these with this structure like to avoid some basic things because.	
38:27.7 - 38:36.6	R3CA: When I read, sometimes I read a lot of translations and you see wow this text is good, but maybe this is a little bit too literal and could have been like in expressed in another way.	
38:37.2 - 38:42.8	R3CA: Maybe machine translation or or a program like that would could offer you this possibility of.	
38:43.4 - 38:54.5	R3CA: there's a structure, maybe you can use or there's something more natural that and maybe give give you more options when you're translating moral equivalence maybe I don't know something like this.	
38:58.2 - 39:07.0	Interviewer: yeah is there anything else, that you would like to comment on the experiment or or reviewing or translation or machine translation or literary translation.	
39:14.5 - 39:19.7	R3CA: It was it was it was really it was really nice, I mean to.	
39:19.7 - 39:33.0	R3CA: See the inner workings of the text and everything it was difficult to sometimes to name to put the category of the things, because this is sometimes it was very subjective and sometimes.	
39:34.6 - 39:44.5	R3CA: The attack was good, but maybe you didn't really know because that happened to me like Oh, this is okay, maybe I would say something else, but I don't really see.	
39:45.5 - 39:50.5	R3CA: Oh, I didn't really occur to me what name could be better for that category or something so.	
39:50.8 - 39:52.9	Interviewer: That was difficult sometimes, how do you.	
39:53.3 - 39:54.6	R3CA: categorize something.	
39:57.3 - 39:58.5	R3CA: But I don't know.	
40:00.5 - 40:06.4	R3CA: I really don't use, for example, just changing the topic I didn't really I didn't use a machine translation for.	
40:07.3 - 40:13.8	R3CA: For literary you or whatever, because well that's mainly that the field, I work with and I feel that.	
40:14.2 - 40:26.4	R3CA: It is very difficult to find something that works for you obviously the engines that you can find for free or or whatever they are not the same as you can develop in a university or or.	
40:27.9 - 40:29.2	R3CA: Or, as an institution.	
40:29.4 - 40:38.5	Interviewer: But yeah but, for example, do you use DeepL or Google translate for certain expressions at all or or.	
40:38.5 - 40:39.4	R3CA: Sometimes yeah.	
40:39.4 - 40:46.2	R3CA: Sometimes yeah especially, for example, for things like between Catalan Spanish Spanish Catalan because.	
40:46.9 - 40:58.2	R3CA: They are so similar that for standard things they can help you DeepL doesn't have Catalan, I think, so that doesn't have then Catalan English I tried.	
40:59.2 - 41:10.5	R3CA: I don't think neither of them are good nor a Google or DeepL there's these other option a friend told me that she that he uses, which is Apertium.	
41:11.2 - 41:12.3	R3CA: that's from the University of Alacant.	
41:15.1 - 41:20.8	R3CA: But also, there are lots of mistakes and lots of things untranslated, so he uses that a lot and.	
41:21.6 - 41:24.8	Interviewer: But for literary texts or for other type of texts?	
41:25.3 - 41:27.1	R3CA: Not not for literary, no I.	
41:27.4 - 41:37.9	R3CA: I don't think i've tried sometimes, but I no because they're not really helpful some things I just try and it's like not really because sometimes if.	
41:39.0 - 41:49.9	R3CA: I mean if if that could make your work like faster than you say Okay, I can use that but for literary I didn't really I don't really see that i've tried like couple of times, some time ago, but I didn't really see that.	
41:50.4 - 41:55.6	R3CA: The engine is so good that that can make my work faster so.	
41:56.6 - 42:04.1	R3CA: I mean, as a means of maybe mmm getting all the vocabulary, so you then have to go to the dictionary then.	
42:04.4 - 42:11.5	R3CA: Be because I feel sometimes that i'm checking in the dictionary things that I already know what it looks like I really have to.	
42:13.3 - 42:23.5	R3CA: Look them up again and then for these that could be a help, but when it depends, you know if the word has different meanings and it depends on the context and then.	
42:24.0 - 42:38.3	R3CA: Sometimes it it really makes you go crazy so for literary that's why I don't I them use that just for like touristic kind of text or text which are like very simple, but not for novels not for books, because I feel like.	
42:40.0 - 42:48.6	R3CA: You really need to change lots of things and not just the not just the way the dialogues go and everything, but many other things.	
42:50.3 - 43:10.0	R3CA: But, as I say, I mean, for example in English Catalan there's nothing that can it's not really DeepL doesn't have it and Google also I mean does it but but it's not that good so so no not really and I feel like, then you have to be like touching and changing lots of thing so.	
43:11.6 - 43:16.8	R3CA: it's not very practical at the moment I don't know, maybe in the near future, but not right now.	
43:19.2 - 43:19.8	Interviewer: Okay.	
43:20.9 - 43:23.8	Interviewer: So i'm going to stop the recording now.
