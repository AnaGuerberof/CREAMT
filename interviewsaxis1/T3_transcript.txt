0:02.6 - 0:03.6	Interviewer: Goedemorgen.	
0:05.0 - 0:05.5	T3NL: Goedemiddag.	
0:05.8 - 0:07.3	Interviewer: Goedemiddag, yeah.	
0:07.9 - 0:08.5	yeah.	
0:09.7 - 0:18.0	Interviewer: I wanted to, to ask you to give me your general views on a translating this text.	
0:20.0 - 0:26.7	T3NL: What it, what was the experience was like for me and only a translation of are also the revision of the of.	
0:27.4 - 0:28.5	Interviewer: The whole process.	
0:28.9 - 0:46.5	T3NL: Okay um well, it is sometimes it felt a bit unnatural because you're working with segments more than we would normally work with normally I the entirety of course I did have the entire text, but because it was already sort of divided into segments that.	
0:48.5 - 1:08.5	T3NL: I had to adjust to that, but um I thought it was really fun text to work with it was it sort of a timeless theme so even though it's an older text you weren't restricted by the time it was written in so that was really nice.	
1:10.5 - 1:25.3	T3NL: And I thought you got to be really creative as a as a translator because it refers to non existing things that need to have a certain rhetoric, I think, and.	
1:27.4 - 1:28.1	T3NL: This this.	
1:29.3 - 1:37.6	T3NL: You have to sort of the the the story is quite believable and you have to make sure in translating that that that that your readers will also.	
1:38.8 - 1:40.4	T3NL: believe what you're saying.	
1:41.9 - 1:45.1	T3NL: So it posed a few.	
1:48.9 - 1:57.7	T3NL: How do you say that a few problems, but it was really fun to try and work them out the one I have most trouble with was actually a title.	
1:59.7 - 2:14.8	T3NL: But then I was, I was looking into all this because, because we, in this day and age we have text language or SMS language so we we all we already.	
2:16.0 - 2:33.9	T3NL: abbreviate words or sentences now in our own ways by didn't find any of those fitting and then, I came across a Dutch play from the 40s or 50s which was called to be you're not to be, and I mean everyday read and knows this phrase so.	
2:35.0 - 2:41.0	T3NL: I thought I could work with that one and then work around the pronunciation.	
2:42.2 - 2:42.5	T3NL: So.	
2:47.3 - 3:07.6	T3NL: What else I thought well the translating part was, I think, easier in a way than the revision part because it's so easy to be fooled by a translation, that is already there, and I mean, even when i'm translating I can I can be fooled by the source text.	
3:07.9 - 3:11.8	Interviewer: Oh, when you say revision you mean you mean the post editing of.	
3:12.1 - 3:13.4	Interviewer: The Text okay.	
3:13.9 - 3:17.8	T3NL: Oh sorry yeah so the second part yeah because.	
3:19.6 - 3:36.3	T3NL: Sometimes you, you only realize On your third or fourth reading that it isn't normal or natural Dutch, where it feels like it is your first reading and I don't think you would normally post edit a translated text that often so.	
3:38.0 - 3:52.6	T3NL: Like I did for my own translations, but I mean normally my editor will look at the text ones, and then send it back to me, so I think there was more editing in there than you would normally do for a translation and.	
3:54.0 - 4:08.4	T3NL: i've been going over the translation again and again in the weekend, just in my head I didn't look at it anymore and i'm thinking that I, if I have a chance, I would still change things in the in the post editing more than I would in the translation, though.	
4:09.2 - 4:14.3	Interviewer: And you mentioned a... the difficulties.	
4:15.8 - 4:17.3	Interviewer: And you mentioned the title.	
4:18.3 - 4:26.2	Interviewer: yeah to be or not to be in numbers a do you recall any other difficulties that you had in the text.	
4:27.3 - 4:28.0	Interviewer: or more.	
4:28.1 - 4:30.3	Interviewer: Or, more problems let's call them.	
4:31.7 - 4:32.4	T3NL: The.	
4:33.6 - 4:36.7	T3NL: The nicknames for the Federal bureau of.	
4:38.2 - 4:40.3	T3NL: termination because.	
4:41.5 - 4:43.8	T3NL: Vonnegut has this way of sort of.	
4:45.4 - 4:55.0	T3NL: The I imagine a lot of them sort of refer to something else as well, and they might have had some sort of sexual references in them as well.	
4:55.2 - 5:08.3	T3NL: So I actually I consulted a an American friend of mine who I often consultant on such problems to see if he had any ideas with two of the titles, I think one of them, the Lucky Pierre.	
5:08.7 - 5:17.8	T3NL: yeah and and the bird Birdland, I think, and he came up with a few things that I already found myself but we discuss it for a while and then I came up with.	
5:18.8 - 5:23.2	T3NL: So, because I felt Lucky Pierre at sort of a sexual innuendo in it and.	
5:25.4 - 5:43.7	T3NL: I came up with a completely new and non existing word in Dutch, which every Dutch reader will understand the reference that is meant by that, even though it has nothing to do with termination or or death or anything and.	
5:44.8 - 5:46.3	T3NL: With Birdland.	
5:48.9 - 6:00.0	T3NL: I think I I I gave myself a bit of freedom there, I cannot reacall now what I did but anyways I I found it, I was trying to find the.	
6:01.0 - 6:15.2	T3NL: innuendos or the the ambiguity for these nicknames actually and to try and and come up with nicknames that have the same ambiguity or the same innuendo the same connotation in them and then.	
6:16.6 - 6:17.8	T3NL: What I also.	
6:22.2 - 6:29.2	T3NL: Your difficulties, I mean there were loads probably well The thing is, once I hand something in I tend to forget um.	
6:34.5 - 6:39.7	T3NL: The thing is, what what what struck me about the source text is that it's all sort of so.	
6:44.0 - 7:01.0	T3NL: Nobody, no one wonders about that situation it's just this is the way it is this is the way the world is now so you need to put that sort of assurance in the translation as well, so, even though the father to be as is.	
7:02.9 - 7:19.2	T3NL: A second thoughts about this and the painter as well, they they do, on the other hand, accept that this is the situation and we need to deal with that we need to find a way to make it work in this situation, and so the, the matter of fact, most of it sort of I tried to.	
7:20.4 - 7:22.6	T3NL: I tried not to embellish that not to make it.	
7:25.7 - 7:32.9	T3NL: Because the language that is used is quite dry, I think he doesn't use a lot of.	
7:35.7 - 7:37.3	T3NL: Descriptions or.	
7:39.0 - 7:39.5	T3NL: or.	
7:42.1 - 7:46.3	T3NL: Is this the word choice, I think, is.	
7:48.0 - 7:50.1	T3NL: Is our everyday words he doesn't.	
7:51.9 - 8:03.4	T3NL: It doesn't fit the language to them story, it is, it is its ordinary language in a in a non ordinary situation I think so, and.	
8:04.4 - 8:25.5	T3NL: Only I think the the lady Leora Duncan she had a way of talking, there was a bit stiff and a bit old fashioned she was the only one, I think, but that was just the with the G and gosh and things like that, so I use a bit of old fashioned a bit archaic exclamations for that and.	
8:27.6 - 8:31.9	T3NL: What I had a problem with is that there was so many reporting clauses.	
8:32.4 - 8:49.3	T3NL: But then, you had so many speakers at some point as well, so I wasn't quite sure where I could leave them out because some point I started to trip over them in in Dutch so but I only took like two I think when it was clear, the word, yes, two speakers going on.	
8:51.8 - 8:54.2	T3NL: Other things the all these these.	
8:55.4 - 9:04.5	T3NL: These well culture specific elements in the to come up with titles that were believable I thought was um was a challenge.	
9:07.1 - 9:08.9	T3NL: Especially for instance the.	
9:10.3 - 9:11.2	T3NL: Ethical.	
9:12.6 - 9:15.2	T3NL: Suicide studios.	
9:15.4 - 9:20.5	T3NL: mm hmm yeah also because I want, I want to try and keep the alliteration in there, but we didn't.	
9:20.6 - 9:22.0	T3NL: Because, in Dutch you can just.	
9:23.0 - 9:34.5	T3NL: Stick words together, so you lose sort of the alliteration as well, but also the all word of the to come up with the correct word for room was.	
9:36.0 - 9:43.0	T3NL: was a bit challenging because it's not the room, and it is a room but it's implies more but studio is something different in Dutch and then.	
9:43.6 - 9:58.2	T3NL: So it was at some point talking to one of my one of the people in my office about this, and she said something like can you use "vertrekken" and "vertrekken" is a sort of a fancy word for a room, but "vertrekken", can also means to leave.	
9:58.3 - 9:58.9	Interviewer: yeah, to exit.	
9:59.0 - 10:07.7	T3NL: yes so um so in the end I use that one so "Ethische Zelfdodingsvertrekken".	
10:09.4 - 10:16.8	T3NL: And also things where it's like hostess we don't have a word for that in Dutch, so I had to come up with a description, that is.	
10:18.5 - 10:20.2	T3NL: So now it was more like a.	
10:24.6 - 10:43.9	T3NL: Someone who guides you through something, but we only actually we only while the word hostess the the Dutch word, for that is only sort of us when you're throwing a party or something so I had to come up with something else that would fit the description.	
10:43.9 - 10:44.5	and	
10:45.6 - 10:50.8	T3NL: Make it sort of like a a job description, instead of a sort of social.	
10:51.0 - 10:54.8	Interviewer: And how do you call the ones that are in the in the planes.	
10:56.0 - 10:56.8	T3NL: Sorry in the?	
10:57.0 - 10:59.6	Interviewer: An air hostess how do you call them?	
11:00.2 - 11:01.2	T3NL: The stewardess.	
11:02.1 - 11:02.9	Interviewer: in Dutch?	
11:03.1 - 11:04.6	Interviewer: Yes, okay.	
11:05.0 - 11:09.9	T3NL: And a hostess is a "gastvrouw" so a guest woman.	
11:10.4 - 11:16.4	Interviewer: yeah yeah, but I think it's more stewardess more the person that helps you.	
11:16.5 - 11:21.5	T3NL: yeah so I made it into a "begeleidsters" so someone who shows you around and.	
11:21.5 - 11:23.1	T3NL: helps you fix things and.	
11:23.5 - 11:35.6	T3NL: Well, basically it's like a teacher or not like a teacher, you can "begeleidster", "begeleiders", so we have the Dutch or the male and female affixes and I chose also when she when she.	
11:36.4 - 11:46.3	T3NL: wants he's trying to find where she wants to be in a painting I use, I had the the painter use old female affixes, so I didn't say not general.	
11:47.0 - 11:57.5	T3NL: So the cutter, or the sniper or but I did use female affixes, and that is that is one of the hardest things in Dutch actually when do you use an affix.	
11:58.2 - 12:15.0	T3NL: The general affixes so that's the male affix, which is sort of general and then the female is the to point to point out that it's female and I tend to do that less and less than my translations actually because sometimes I find it puts too much.	
12:16.3 - 12:21.6	T3NL: stress on the fact that this is about females are instead of people in general.	
12:23.4 - 12:32.2	Interviewer: It happened there with their words doctor and nurse, at least in in in Catalan.	
12:32.5 - 12:51.4	Interviewer: and in Spanish, you have this problem that people tend to use the generic feminine for nurse and the generic masculine for for doctor which is a bit stereotyping and so did you have that problem as well or.	
12:51.4 - 12:53.3	Interviewer: or in Dutch do you have generics?	
12:53.8 - 13:08.1	T3NL: We have not... doctor is actually generic in Dutch, so we don't it doesn't get a female affix and nurse, you have "zuster", which is a female nurse, and that is what people tend to say, but we also have the word "verpleiger" well "verpleegkundigen".	
13:10.1 - 13:23.3	T3NL: which you can abbreviate to "verpleiger" which is male and "verpleegester" which is female so I went for but I chose because it's a man coming down the hall, and I made it to "verpleeghulp" so that's and aid.	
13:24.2 - 13:25.8	Interviewer: an aid yeah.	
13:26.2 - 13:28.7	T3NL: And that is again a generic word.	
13:31.0 - 13:35.0	T3NL: But I have, I often come across nurses in my.	
13:36.1 - 13:38.7	T3NL: Translations but it's often at a.	
13:40.6 - 13:43.9	T3NL: In also in the birthing.	
13:45.3 - 13:51.4	T3NL: Center or something like that, but most of the time it's women so when I can I because.	
13:52.9 - 14:06.4	T3NL: We tend to we still tend to say in idiomatically, we can say "zuster", so the female form unless unless you need to unless you can specify and then we say "verpleegkundigen".	
14:07.5 - 14:14.9	T3NL: Depending on context I choose what I need for that, but for the for the painting, I chose a general generic word.	
14:15.4 - 14:15.9	Okay.	
14:17.0 - 14:21.1	Interviewer: And what about the names of the characters did you ponder about that?	
14:22.4 - 14:26.6	T3NL: No, I, I think that in Dutch tradition is.	
14:28.9 - 14:30.9	T3NL: it's it's not to change.	
14:32.1 - 14:47.4	T3NL: The names unless it's children's literature literature and I could do the word play on Duncan I could do it in Dutch so so the painter says you so you dunk people and.	
14:48.6 - 14:50.2	T3NL: I turned it into so you.	
14:51.9 - 15:04.5	T3NL: I use a euphemism for kill, so you kill people to your own "goed-dunken" and "dunken" to your your own that is basically to your own judgment, so I could still.	
15:06.1 - 15:10.7	T3NL: Put a hyphen in there, so it would sort of set the word off from there.	
15:11.1 - 15:12.4	T3NL: But I could still use it.	
15:12.6 - 15:22.0	Interviewer: yeah okay and and you mentioned as well and that the word that you had to be very creative in this text.	
15:22.2 - 15:28.1	Interviewer: yeah and you used the word creative.	
15:28.6 - 15:45.6	Interviewer: yeah So my question is where would you say, maybe you have mentioned it already right but to summarize Where would you say you have to be more creative and how would you define creativity in translation.	
15:46.4 - 15:47.1	T3NL: Well yeah well.	
15:47.2 - 15:53.8	Interviewer: Considering that there is no right or wrong answer, how would you explain it to somebody?	
15:55.3 - 15:56.0	T3NL: Oh.	
15:57.5 - 16:03.8	T3NL: Well i've read a lot of theories about translation and one of my.	
16:05.3 - 16:15.8	T3NL: What I tried to do is give the Dutch reader the experience I would think the reader of the original text would have someone who would fully understand the original language.	
16:17.4 - 16:18.0	T3NL: So.	
16:20.6 - 16:21.8	T3NL: You have to find out it.	
16:23.0 - 16:31.6	T3NL: Or, I had to work out is it in in in plot, or is it in form or syntax or is it the.	
16:36.8 - 16:40.6	T3NL: Where basically where where did the writer put his.	
16:41.9 - 16:42.3	T3NL: or.	
16:43.6 - 16:44.6	T3NL: How do you you say that.	
16:46.6 - 16:50.4	T3NL: Where did the writer put his hooks sort of.	
16:50.4 - 16:55.4	T3NL: I tried to find those and then see if I if the.	
16:56.8 - 16:57.4	T3NL: If I would.	
16:58.5 - 17:03.7	T3NL: sort of translated dry *** but it was still there, and if not, I had to try and find a way to put a hook in the.	
17:04.8 - 17:15.0	T3NL: In the in the translation as well, so that you sort of catch the reader or it gets the attention of the reader on a certain phrase I think um.	
17:19.4 - 17:20.1	T3NL: let's see.	
17:22.9 - 17:24.3	T3NL: What creativity was.	
17:27.4 - 17:28.4	Interviewer: The question is.	
17:29.8 - 17:31.9	Interviewer: How would you define creativity.	
17:32.1 - 17:32.8	T3NL: How would I define.	
17:34.1 - 17:35.7	T3NL: Okay, oh i'm.	
17:36.1 - 17:37.5	Interviewer: In translation right.	
17:37.6 - 17:37.7	Not in writing.	
17:39.0 - 17:40.9	T3NL: would have to be able to.	
17:45.2 - 17:47.7	T3NL: Try and interpret how.	
17:48.7 - 17:58.8	T3NL: The writer would have said it had he been Dutch so not what is he saying in English, but how would he have said it had he been Dutch so.	
18:01.0 - 18:04.7	T3NL: I think there was a lot of a lot of it wasn't tone, I think.	
18:05.1 - 18:14.0	T3NL: The one that was also what what people are saying, but also you could distill from the source text the way they were saying it.	
18:14.5 - 18:28.3	T3NL: So that is very that has a lot of effect on how you build up your sentences in Dutch, so not you don't just follow the source text but it's really like okay he's trying to convey a message here.	
18:29.9 - 18:30.8	T3NL: So.	
18:33.7 - 18:35.9	T3NL: Do we even use this phrasing.	
18:37.8 - 18:56.0	T3NL: And that is where you sort of let go of the source text and you start to hover above it, I think, and then go through your mind and through the Internet, and through every resource that you have to see what, how do we actually say this in Dutch, and I think that is where you.	
18:57.0 - 19:03.5	T3NL: where you are, at the same time you trying to be creative but you're also trying to be reflective instead of constantly working on your reflex.	
19:04.7 - 19:06.7	T3NL: which I think is very hard, when you are.	
19:07.8 - 19:14.1	T3NL: I think it's harder to be creative when you are doing the post-editing because you've already been served with.	
19:16.5 - 19:19.0	T3NL: A piece of language, that you.	
19:20.4 - 19:23.4	T3NL: So your interpretation is already.	
19:24.6 - 19:37.4	T3NL: Halfway filled in for you, instead of you coming up with your own interpretation and trying to figure out if it's the correct interpretation you already get a piece of interpretation and that that starts to.	
19:40.6 - 19:42.2	T3NL: That takes, I think it takes.	
19:43.3 - 19:53.4	T3NL: away a bit from what you would do what you would normally do, and it can it can be very helpful, but it can also be a very big trap I think so um.	
19:53.5 - 19:55.1	Interviewer: So, how was it helpful?	
19:56.3 - 19:57.3	T3NL: um.	
20:00.1 - 20:02.9	T3NL: Well What surprised me was that some in some.	
20:04.9 - 20:07.5	T3NL: Some of the machine translations that.	
20:09.8 - 20:18.4	T3NL: The syntax being completely turned around or a sentence had been made passive instead of active, where it was active in the source stack so I thought okay that.	
20:21.0 - 20:29.6	T3NL: The the corpus that this machine translation is sort of getting its information from his must be really, really wide if he knows how to.	
20:31.3 - 20:46.2	T3NL: How to turn a sentence around, and I mean i'm teaching, so I i'm actually teaching my students to turn sentences around and sometimes it's it is more idiomatic in Dutch, to use a passive, whereas an active in form in Dutch.	
20:47.2 - 20:51.0	T3NL: But at the same time, like I said earlier, is that it's it's.	
20:53.8 - 20:55.2	T3NL: It also feeds you.	
20:56.8 - 20:59.1	T3NL: Solutions or translations that are not.	
21:01.7 - 21:07.7	T3NL: correct, but you can't put your finger on it, and then I think you start to to look for false instead of.	
21:08.8 - 21:10.0	T3NL: Trying to.	
21:11.1 - 21:13.7	T3NL: Instead of going back to the source text and then.	
21:15.1 - 21:16.4	T3NL: Work from that you start to.	
21:16.4 - 21:18.9	T3NL: work from the translation actually.	
21:20.0 - 21:20.8	T3NL: So.	
21:22.8 - 21:26.3	T3NL: So that is what I was in my first post-editing round.	
21:26.8 - 21:36.1	T3NL: I was really focused on the existing translation and then, then the second one I started, I was more focused on the.	
21:37.1 - 21:42.5	T3NL: source sex and at some point you just when when you when you think okay now it's sort of.	
21:43.1 - 21:52.8	T3NL: i'm the meaning I the meaning is OK, then I go back to just the translation and I just and then and I really felt Okay, how do you say this and.	
21:53.2 - 22:07.1	T3NL: I know what he means I know where what they trying to convey, but this is not completely to my liking in Dutch there's too much English sort of seeping through either in context or and syntax or in word choice or.	
22:08.4 - 22:09.8	T3NL: yeah things like that.	
22:11.2 - 22:13.0	Interviewer: So you mentioned.	
22:17.2 - 22:24.8	Interviewer: that this was a big different this translating process, but can you explain a little bit how.	
22:26.1 - 22:35.9	Interviewer: How was your translation process here, like, for example, what i'm trying to say say what you were explaining like do you read English first and do you look.	
22:36.4 - 22:51.6	Interviewer: You know, some people read first the source text look at vocabulary, that is, start translating other people start translating they don't even read the English and then they read English, you know what is your process, how do you do it, how did you work this translation.	
22:52.1 - 23:05.8	T3NL: I always try to read the source text first with an open mind, but I always start making notes on my first reading, even if I don't want to I can, because some things pop into your head and i'm afraid that they won't come back.	
23:06.2 - 23:23.6	T3NL: Like, for instance, this oh That was what the song is in there, so the first time I translated I just wrote out this song, it was brilliant and I I I close the file and I opened it the wrong way so everything was gone and I couldn't get it back, I have no idea I.	
23:23.6 - 23:25.5	T3NL: mean so on the sentences were still sort of.	
23:25.5 - 23:37.0	T3NL: yeah I go, I know I did that I had no idea what this and this brilliant rhyme scheme, I mean, I still have a rhyme scheme but it's not as good as the first one, and I just couldn't come up with it anymore.	
23:37.6 - 23:39.2	T3NL: Though um.	
23:39.9 - 23:48.4	T3NL: yeah so there's I always read the source text first and make a few notes and then I just start at the beginning and.	
23:51.5 - 24:06.5	T3NL: Basically, work to the end, so when I finished the translation, I immediately continue with the post-editing, because then, I want to maintain that flow of the texts and see if I if if I have the right flow actually so.	
24:08.0 - 24:17.2	T3NL: Also, the my own editing rounds I just I would go back to my translation and once I finished it, I would again go back to the post editing and.	
24:19.5 - 24:22.6	T3NL: Yes, i'm a very chronological translator.	
24:23.1 - 24:26.2	Interviewer: And then do you review?	
24:26.3 - 24:32.2	Interviewer: Or how do you approach the review, do you let it rest, do you how do you how do you work that out.	
24:32.6 - 24:42.3	T3NL: I, my first translations always quite crude, I think, and that is what I didn't like because normally I put like three or four different options.	
24:42.7 - 24:50.3	T3NL: In my translation I just use boards and slashes or sometimes good things in square hooks to see maybe I want I just think this is.	
24:50.9 - 25:02.3	T3NL: redundant information which I don't really need in Dutch and, but I find it found hard to use that in the in the in the software programs so um so that was or something I just put.	
25:03.4 - 25:06.0	T3NL: comments in there as well just.	
25:07.3 - 25:10.0	T3NL: To see what other options, I will have or different.	
25:11.9 - 25:20.8	T3NL: different lines of thought, maybe So for me that was not working in a normal Word file that was made it a bit harder um.	
25:22.0 - 25:22.9	T3NL: But.	
25:24.2 - 25:28.8	T3NL: So my first version is always quite crude with a lot of.	
25:30.3 - 25:52.1	T3NL: Extra options in it, and a lot of questions to myself questions to that I need to ask native speakers or questions that I might need to ask the writer, if there is a possibility for that so um yeah I think my first ones nation might be like I don't know 30% longer than be final.	
25:53.6 - 25:56.4	T3NL: Final work um.	
25:58.3 - 26:07.0	T3NL: yeah it's basically but I once I have the first translation finished, I put it away and I went back, I think, after two days.	
26:07.5 - 26:18.9	T3NL: And then I did editing and I put it away again, so I let it rest for another two days and did another round of editing the way again and then something something POPs in my head and I open everything again because.	
26:21.2 - 26:25.4	T3NL: You just need to change something so I think I had about four or five rounds.	
26:25.7 - 26:36.9	T3NL: And then certain certain segments that I had already on the I made some notes on the on the I printed them out, so I made some notes to to.	
26:37.8 - 26:53.0	T3NL: with different lines of thought man as well, for instance with the whole ethical suicide studios so I was looking at different words for suicide different word for studios different well also for ethical, even so, so some.	
26:54.3 - 26:56.1	T3NL: Problems i'll just have them.	
26:57.4 - 27:03.4	T3NL: write them down in different in a separate file and just chew on them for a while.	
27:05.6 - 27:06.3	Interviewer: and	
27:07.4 - 27:19.8	Interviewer: I was going to ask you if, after this processing in this case, are you satisfied with the translation that you did, are you satisfied with your final.	
27:21.3 - 27:22.2	T3NL: I have never satisfied.	
27:24.3 - 27:34.9	T3NL: i'm satisfied for now like normally and once it's after i've handed it in it will go to an editor and they will send it to me and then.	
27:35.9 - 27:48.9	T3NL: i'm not allowed to make too many changes but generally I do and it isn't until the final round and i'm really not allowed to make any real changes unless there are real mistakes in there, but because there's more time.	
27:50.7 - 27:55.1	T3NL: there's like a few weeks in between them, so you really have time to let it sort of rest and.	
27:56.9 - 28:03.7	T3NL: Even disappear from your mind for a bit, and I was this was sort of constantly at the back of my mind so um.	
28:04.6 - 28:20.7	T3NL: So you can't really sort of look at it from a distance anymore, and I think that that really worked for me, and I know that this, especially when you have I just got this this question about if I could do a our translation just now and I don't have time, but I was thinking.	
28:22.5 - 28:29.5	T3NL: I don't even want to do it in one day because I want to be able to go back and go back to the text and then look at it again with a fresh or.	
28:30.5 - 28:46.4	T3NL: With a fresh view, basically, so I am I, what I do, I read the entire translation, including post-edited part to myself twice us to see if, once if I stumble while reading it out loud.	
28:47.0 - 28:55.0	T3NL: Then I know I need I need to change something, but I asked you, I had to laugh a few times as well, so, then I think okay I got a few things right.	
28:55.7 - 28:58.1	Interviewer: Right right that's a good indicator.	
28:58.4 - 29:01.9	Interviewer: yeah and also, you mentioned that.	
29:04.2 - 29:11.1	Interviewer: Sometimes you were surprise, a day, then the proposals from the machine.	
29:11.3 - 29:17.1	Interviewer: yeah So my question is, what did you think of the MT proposals.	
29:18.3 - 29:23.0	T3NL: And what I also found surprising, was it wasn't consistent.	
29:23.6 - 29:30.8	T3NL: Like, for instance triplets which is "drieling" in Dutch, it said triplets the first few times and then suddenly came up with "drieling".	
29:32.5 - 29:43.9	T3NL: And sometimes if it seemed like the machine translation use the right context to interpret and sometimes it completely miss context, so the meaning.	
29:44.2 - 29:55.4	T3NL: Of the sentence on its own would work, for instance, when he shoots Leora he says room for two but it hasn't been translation as a room like a hotel room for.	
29:55.4 - 29:56.5	T3NL: Two in Dutch.	
29:56.7 - 29:57.2	So.	
29:58.7 - 30:09.4	T3NL: That would be like semantically if it's a perfectly correct translation, but in the context it doesn't work at all we limited space sort of and.	
30:10.8 - 30:17.6	T3NL: So I I thought the level of machine translation was.	
30:20.0 - 30:26.7	T3NL: I think if you leave it like this, people would know it was a machine translation, but.	
30:28.6 - 30:38.7	T3NL: Isolated sentences, a lot of them do work, but in the contract as a story as a whole, it is there is not enough.	
30:41.3 - 30:44.1	T3NL: Coherence I think so.	
30:47.9 - 30:52.6	T3NL: Well, ended up for post-editing you, you know the context, so you can work with that, but.	
30:53.9 - 31:01.2	T3NL: If you were to use this to translate a novel I think as opposed editor you would have a lot of work and think I wish I translate it myself.	
31:03.7 - 31:08.8	Interviewer: Oh, so how, how do you think this post-editing.	
31:09.8 - 31:14.6	Interviewer: Affected your creativity what, what do you think this impact is?	
31:17.0 - 31:19.2	Interviewer: On your creativity in particular.	
31:21.0 - 31:28.9	T3NL: I think it actually showed me things that I would never think of myself, because it always tend to think outside of the box, instead of inside the box.	
31:29.2 - 31:43.2	T3NL: So sometimes it is as easy as it seems most times I actually have this this quote this quotation on a on a title which that says turn everything into a problem.	
31:43.8 - 31:54.3	T3NL: And because my teacher at the university used to tell that to me and then my my sister had to put on the title and I after two years, I took the title down because I turned everything into a problem not just my work.	
31:56.8 - 31:57.3	T3NL: But.	
31:57.4 - 31:58.3	So.	
31:59.6 - 32:00.6	T3NL: mmm.	
32:01.8 - 32:13.2	T3NL: It I don't know if it fooled me sometimes that it can be as simple as it seems, or that it actually is it's certain phrases are as simple as they seem.	
32:14.3 - 32:21.2	T3NL: But, for instance, the the name of the the painting of the mural the happy garden of life.	
32:22.2 - 32:27.2	T3NL: which I thought was surprising I didn't use the Dutch general word for garden and which is "tuin".	
32:28.6 - 32:45.7	T3NL: "tuin", but like both myself and then I found in translation, as well used "hof", which refers to the biblical garden sort of even if "hof" it's not biblical but it's the more archaic word of saying is and it and, in this context, I thought okay it's more "hof".	
32:46.7 - 32:50.6	T3NL: than "tuin" because so people will have this reference to this whole sort of paradise.	
32:52.4 - 32:57.3	T3NL: idea, so I was surprised that the translation actually came up with that.	
32:58.2 - 33:02.1	Interviewer: The machine translation, yes, .	
33:02.2 - 33:11.8	T3NL: So not the generic and much more often used word of "tuin", but the more specific and sort of archaic word "hof" so.	
33:11.9 - 33:13.0	Interviewer: Because this.	
33:14.8 - 33:25.1	Interviewer: sentence in in the English text, it appeared in the beginning, and then in your PE so first you translated as "tuin", and then, when you found.	
33:25.2 - 33:25.5	T3NL: "hof".	
33:26.1 - 33:27.8	T3NL: I translated it as "hof" as well.	
33:29.2 - 33:31.5	Interviewer: yeah it coincided with you.	
33:31.6 - 33:44.6	T3NL: yeah yeah and I would have never thought that the machine translation would choose "hof" for that I would thought thing that they would usethe ordinary words "huis","tuin", "keuken",  so house, kitchen, garden word for it so that's just generic.	
33:46.9 - 33:59.0	T3NL: And it didn't it used the more archaic biblical it sort of came up with this context there, even though there was no reason for this machine translation, to put it in this context, I think.	
34:00.0 - 34:02.0	Interviewer: Maybe you know we did say.	
34:03.1 - 34:05.9	Interviewer: A the uppercase system that.	
34:06.3 - 34:07.2	Interviewer: yeah you.	
34:07.4 - 34:10.7	T3NL: could be that and that is because we don't use these upper cases in Dutch.	
34:11.1 - 34:12.6	T3NL: hmm no.	
34:13.8 - 34:15.4	Interviewer: One wanted to ask you.	
34:15.5 - 34:18.1	Interviewer: And you sort of mentioned this.	
34:19.1 - 34:35.1	Interviewer: Earlier, you said that the readers will know this is machine, so my question is if the readers were to have a text that was only machine translated the full text yeah.	
34:36.4 - 34:41.2	Interviewer: And another text that was fully human.	
34:42.4 - 34:45.2	Interviewer: And another text that was post-edited.	
34:46.3 - 34:48.5	Interviewer: So three modalities.	
34:48.6 - 34:54.2	Interviewer: yeah, what do you think the impact would be on the reader of these texts.	
34:55.0 - 34:56.6	T3NL: When they read all three of them.	
34:58.8 - 35:00.8	Interviewer: separately, obviously, but yeah.	
35:03.0 - 35:09.4	T3NL: I think that the machine translation will have less impact.	
35:12.5 - 35:13.7	T3NL: contents wise.	
35:14.8 - 35:26.6	T3NL: Because it is well the context it gets is it strength, both from the form and syntax and idiom and I think the machine translation is a bit too.	
35:28.4 - 35:34.4	T3NL: Rigid for that to make it a book it it's almost like it's it's.	
35:37.3 - 35:38.2	T3NL: um.	
35:40.4 - 35:41.4	T3NL: it's like.	
35:45.3 - 35:50.8	T3NL: Well, I think it lacks a bit of creativity to make make it believable so it's.	
35:52.1 - 35:59.2	T3NL: it's more like stating facts then then turning the facts into a story and.	
36:01.0 - 36:04.6	T3NL: The machine translation, it was a lot better than I had expected.	
36:06.8 - 36:11.4	T3NL: Though, but I think that it misses the.	
36:12.4 - 36:16.9	T3NL: sort of the edge, we say "shoe" in Dutch, so the sort of.	
36:20.2 - 36:24.2	T3NL: how do you say that it's like "de smeermiddel".	
36:25.6 - 36:27.0	Interviewer: The "nuances".	
36:27.4 - 36:28.8	Interviewer: the naunces.	
36:28.9 - 36:32.2	T3NL: yeah but also it's sort of a things that make it sort of.	
36:37.7 - 36:39.9	T3NL: Like give it a certain flow, I think.	
36:41.1 - 36:53.8	T3NL: And also, and that is one of the most the hardest things I think like it doesn't use these into these sort of meaningless words that we inject everywhere in Dutch.	
36:54.2 - 36:56.5	T3NL: So it becomes quite staccato.	
36:57.7 - 37:10.4	T3NL: We use like "hoor", "wel", "eigenlijk" completely meaningless words but we interject them in language, and that is what sort of gives it gives them more natural feel.	
37:10.8 - 37:24.8	T3NL: When it's not sort of narrators language, I think, but when it's a person's thoughts or a person spoken language, and I think to a reader, it would be... the machine translation would be too dry in this aspect.	
37:27.4 - 37:31.8	T3NL: i'm hoping that in my post-editing I that the.	
37:33.1 - 37:41.7	T3NL: It has the same tone as the the translated part hat, so that you don't have like that doesn't feel like that has been split in half.	
37:43.6 - 37:50.6	T3NL: And because I let go of the source text in my final translation and just really worked with the.	
37:52.4 - 37:58.4	T3NL: With the idea of how is this set in Dutch when going through the final post-editing.	
38:00.6 - 38:07.3	T3NL: i'm hoping that it just really continued the flow and the tone, I used in the actual translation so.	
38:07.6 - 38:10.1	Interviewer: So that they wouldn't notice.	
38:10.3 - 38:15.4	T3NL: No, but that's what I didn't really like about the about the program that I couldn't.	
38:17.0 - 38:25.4	T3NL: Get once I changed something in the in the machine translation I couldn't find any more what it was before then.	
38:26.6 - 38:32.8	T3NL: Maybe I changed something and then on the later revision, maybe I changed it back I don't know.	
38:36.0 - 38:36.8	T3NL: um.	
38:38.2 - 38:41.9	T3NL: So yeah so i'm hoping that I really kept the same.	
38:43.3 - 38:44.4	T3NL: tone of voice.	
38:45.4 - 38:56.5	T3NL: In the post-editing as well, and I think the what what people will find in a in a translation that has been done completely by a translator that if it's been translated...	
38:57.8 - 39:02.9	T3NL: Well, that they will it will all be in the same style and.	
39:04.4 - 39:06.1	T3NL: You shouldn't have any sort of.	
39:09.3 - 39:15.7	T3NL: The text going one way than the other way and she just really sort of follow a certain line I guess.	
39:17.1 - 39:22.3	T3NL: Because it's quite a short text so a translator should be able to maintain that.	
39:23.5 - 39:24.4	Maintain that.	
39:26.9 - 39:32.2	Interviewer: If if publishing houses were to use MT.	
39:33.2 - 39:39.5	Interviewer: To translate certain books, what do you think would be the long term effect.	
39:40.3 - 39:41.9	T3NL: I think that's.	
39:46.1 - 40:06.7	T3NL: I think that we would use a part of our language, I think that, because I, as a translator use a certain corpus of language that I know that I have heard that I have read and machine translation uses a corpus as well, but it will, I think, use.	
40:07.8 - 40:18.3	T3NL: or make decisions based on frequency quite often, so the exceptions words that you, you only use every.	
40:19.9 - 40:26.6	T3NL: every once in once in a while, or certain phrases of certain sayings that they might get lost.	
40:27.8 - 40:38.6	T3NL: because their frequency becomes less and less once you get more machines, but I do believe that in about 30 years we won't have translators anymore, I think so.	
40:38.9 - 40:39.8	Interviewer: Oh, really.	
40:39.8 - 40:40.3	T3NL: yeah.	
40:40.3 - 40:42.2	Interviewer: Even for literature?	
40:43.5 - 40:49.6	T3NL: I think it will at some point be machine translations being post-edited yes.	
40:50.8 - 40:51.8	Interviewer: Post-edited.	
40:51.9 - 40:57.4	Interviewer: Okay yeah but how do you feel that would impact the language, then, if everything is post-edited.	
40:58.5 - 41:04.6	T3NL: I think um it goes if I look at my editors they won't.	
41:05.8 - 41:06.9	T3NL: Really.	
41:09.2 - 41:16.8	T3NL: Sometimes i'm thinking How can an editor have missed this really weird weird thing I wrote down, so I think.	
41:19.2 - 41:23.3	T3NL: You will be lulled into some sort of.	
41:25.2 - 41:30.5	T3NL: Generic language that is that is used and and.	
41:32.0 - 41:33.2	T3NL: sort of lose.	
41:34.6 - 41:47.5	T3NL: lose sort of all the the enormous variety of possibilities of language, I think it will sort of narrow down into more once it starts to narrow down what only narrow down more.	
41:48.8 - 41:52.6	T3NL: I think that that might be an effect, I have no idea, but this is just.	
41:52.6 - 41:53.7	Interviewer: Of course, of course.	
41:53.7 - 42:08.7	Interviewer: yeah and when you translate we are coming here to an end when you translate do you use say, for example, Google translator or DeepL or Linguee or any other tool to translate.	
42:08.9 - 42:23.8	T3NL: Linguee, sometimes to if it's if it's about terminology I don't really I don't know how to fit that into a certain context, so I will never use it for a sentence.	
42:25.6 - 42:27.9	T3NL: But I will use it for.	
42:32.3 - 42:37.1	T3NL: Like what was our unit, I might even have used it for what something in this text.	
42:37.8 - 42:39.5	Interviewer: This is Linguee or DeepL.	
42:40.1 - 42:40.7	T3NL: Linguee.	
42:40.9 - 42:42.2	T3NL: Linguee yeah.	
42:43.3 - 42:44.4	T3NL: Linguee uses DeepL.	
42:45.4 - 42:51.5	Interviewer: A yeah more DeepL uses the corpus from Linguee.	
42:51.8 - 42:54.9	Interviewer: In the end Linguee is parallel text.	
42:55.0 - 42:55.4	T3NL: Okay.	
42:55.4 - 43:00.2	Interviewer: yeah they are showing you right yeah .	
43:00.3 - 43:03.1	T3NL: I also what I find about Linguee is that they use a lot of it seems like machine translations as well.	
43:03.8 - 43:05.0	Interviewer: Possibly...	
43:05.0 - 43:13.7	T3NL: yeah so so that is why no I can't depend on that it just sort of to see what context, these these words I sort of used.	
43:13.9 - 43:17.2	Interviewer: Linguee normally at the bottom, it has the source.	
43:17.2 - 43:24.2	T3NL: yeah yeah it does, but like the if it's a Dutch website, for instance, they might just as well use a.	
43:24.2 - 43:32.2	T3NL: Yeah like, for instance Ali express or something it's also based on Linguee, and Alex once uses machine translation.	
43:32.4 - 43:34.6	T3NL: But they will appear on Linguee.	
43:35.0 - 43:50.3	T3NL: So I am I use it, but with caution, because I think it might be correct, but it might just be a machine translation and especially when it's about terminology that we don't actually have a Dutch word for.	
43:50.8 - 43:57.9	T3NL: or an expression, then with expressions, they tend to translate quite literal.	
43:58.6 - 44:07.9	T3NL: And with terminology, they might find something similar or, for instance, at some point, I was thought I was asked to do something that wasn't a roofer.	
44:08.2 - 44:21.5	T3NL: In the text was working with shingles and I was thinking Oh, do we use this word or this word or this word for shingles and then, I came across texts about roofs but then with the shingles as a rash.	
44:22.5 - 44:29.7	T3NL: insert into the text, and this was on Linguee or something like that so it's it's a lot of it has not been post edited I would think.	
44:30.4 - 44:30.8	Right.	
44:33.0 - 44:33.5	Interviewer: yeah.	
44:33.8 - 44:35.6	T3NL: So, so I do use it, but.	
44:36.0 - 44:38.6	T3NL: i'm never as a final answer.	
44:39.6 - 44:40.2	T3NL: I think.	
44:40.8 - 44:41.0	You know.	
44:42.2 - 44:45.7	Interviewer: If you were if you had a magic wand or.	
44:46.7 - 45:00.9	Interviewer: If you could How would you like MT to be or how would you like technology to be or how How would how could MT or technology help you.	
45:02.6 - 45:08.0	Interviewer: In the case of a literary translator What would you like to have if anything.	
45:08.9 - 45:21.2	T3NL: I would really like it, I think we should already have programs like MemoQ, to be sort of warned about certain sentence structures and.	
45:22.5 - 45:23.2	T3NL: How.	
45:24.7 - 45:29.2	T3NL: Certain word combinations are used, because sometimes, especially when you have like a very.	
45:32.9 - 45:44.6	T3NL: very long novel to translate you might sort of miss out on certain references to something that's been said earlier, or some certain phrasings so rapid repetitions and phrasing.	
45:46.1 - 45:46.7	T3NL: I was.	
45:47.8 - 45:59.7	T3NL: I was talking with my students and I had them translate this very short story and only when I was sort of it was part of a much bigger novel, but when I was.	
46:02.8 - 46:20.3	T3NL: Revising their translations I realized oh wait there's a motive in this story I had already found the theme, but the motive only appeared to me on reading it 8th time in in in revising, so I think it might.	
46:22.0 - 46:24.0	T3NL: sort of if it were to.	
46:27.9 - 46:36.9	T3NL: sort of warrant you for certain occurrences in in word choice or phrasing I think that would be really helpful um.	
46:38.0 - 46:38.7	T3NL: and	
46:45.0 - 46:45.9	T3NL: i'm.	
46:51.3 - 46:52.0	T3NL: I don't know.	
47:04.7 - 47:06.2	T3NL: I don't know actually because.	
47:08.2 - 47:19.4	T3NL: Good aid, and I mean i've used it for languages, I don't know and then to have a sort of first impression of the text to.	
47:20.4 - 47:21.2	T3NL: to know.	
47:22.5 - 47:26.2	T3NL: Because, sometimes I will I was translating something from.	
47:27.7 - 47:36.2	T3NL: Ukraine Ukrainian texts that have been translated into really poor English, and so I use a German translation.	
47:36.8 - 47:55.5	T3NL: Of the Ukrainian texts, and then I use Google translate to see if I understood the German translation correctly, because the English translator of the Ukrainian text her English was not good enough to come up with a good solution so and I found that really, really helpful so.	
47:57.2 - 47:59.6	T3NL: So basically to get the gist, but I think if.	
48:01.2 - 48:07.9	T3NL: I think machine translations do help you understand the gist but I don't think they will help you understand the finesse of the writer.	
48:09.3 - 48:28.3	T3NL: I think it's it's more about that, and so, if you have something that is already sort of producing a text for you like, I said, you can be fooled so easily as a translator into or lulls into a certain feeling of security that this is a correct translation, when in fact it's not so.	
48:29.8 - 48:36.6	T3NL: yeah but, oh no that was not the question, the question is, how would have been if I had a magic wand, I would like it to.	
48:43.3 - 48:44.0	T3NL: well.	
48:52.1 - 48:56.0	T3NL: What we're really helpful something i'm struggling with with my current.	
48:58.3 - 49:02.2	T3NL: novel is that I don't know how.	
49:03.7 - 49:15.8	T3NL: The state is of certain words and phrases in the American English so, for instance, if something is really rude or just a generic.	
49:19.4 - 49:20.6	T3NL: curse or if it's.	
49:23.2 - 49:27.9	T3NL: Like a lot of sayings in this text are very local.	
49:28.4 - 49:29.4	T3NL: So you get the.	
49:29.5 - 49:51.4	T3NL: gist of what they mean, but you really need native speakers of this from a certain area to get or or the writer it to explain it to you what the actual what which means into detail so that will be really helpful, especially because a lot of my time goes into research.	
49:53.0 - 49:57.2	Interviewer: More on the source text so technology to analyze the source text.	
49:57.2 - 49:57.9	Interviewer: More than there.	
49:58.5 - 49:58.8	yeah.	
50:00.1 - 50:16.0	T3NL: yeah think more for yeah but that might be just my arrogance thinking, I know better, because they do believe that computers are capable of so many things much more than we we can ever imagine so.	
50:16.5 - 50:21.0	Interviewer: Well you have seen what a machine can do here with the text in Dutch.	
50:21.4 - 50:21.9	yeah.	
50:25.5 - 50:29.2	T3NL: yeah I think it will only get better it will get better every year.	
50:30.3 - 50:35.0	T3NL: And will get better and higher speed than the previous year, so.	
50:36.3 - 50:39.8	T3NL: But like I said, I do think that, in the end it will sort of.	
50:42.2 - 50:57.4	T3NL: flatten the language, somehow, like all the the I can't come up with the English word we say "uit***" so everything that is sort of not in the normal vernacular but everything that is sort of that stands out.	
50:58.7 - 51:00.4	T3NL: I think those things will get lost.	
51:00.4 - 51:01.4	Interviewer: At some point.	
51:01.9 - 51:03.3	T3NL: It will, it will be.	
51:05.9 - 51:06.3	T3NL: traveling.	
51:06.4 - 51:11.4	Interviewer: What does that mean for the brain, what does that mean for the future generations then.	
51:11.8 - 51:14.8	T3NL: I think that we will be challenged less and less.	
51:16.6 - 51:18.1	T3NL: I think that might be.	
51:19.1 - 51:22.8	T3NL: Because we are all affected by our inputs.	
51:23.6 - 51:24.3	Interviewer: And, of course.	
51:24.5 - 51:26.1	T3NL: And if our input becomes.	
51:27.5 - 51:34.3	T3NL: A more generic than our what our output becomes becomes that as well, I think.	
51:37.3 - 51:54.8	T3NL: that's what I really like about, for instance Shakespeare that he came up with so many expressions that are now that i've still being used and and just through his creativity and there's also getting the worst thing to translate or having to translate as a.	
51:56.6 - 52:01.6	T3NL: into documents and because it doesn't have that same connotation in Dutch.	
52:02.5 - 52:12.4	T3NL: it's always sort of are you going to do, choose form over meaning, or do you choose meaning over connotation, or what it's just.	
52:14.9 - 52:18.5	T3NL: But that's also what makes it really, really fun to.	
52:19.8 - 52:33.3	T3NL: To try and put every aspect of the source text into the into the translation, and if you can't to see if you if there's any way you can compensate somewhere else and i'm thinking would a machine ever try and compensate ...	
52:35.4 - 52:56.0	T3NL: Some sort of wordplay that he lost in in one place, because there is no double meaning or innuendo or there is no alliteration going on Will he will the computer than think Oh, but wait we're two paragraphs down, but here, this is a ideal place for a word play I don't know.	
52:56.3 - 52:57.1	T3NL: And if it does.	
52:57.6 - 53:04.0	T3NL: Is it then still does it still do justice to the source text and to the writer of the source text so.	
53:05.2 - 53:05.6	T3NL: yeah.	
53:06.4 - 53:06.8	yeah.	
53:08.8 - 53:14.9	Interviewer: Is there anything I say you would like to add about our conversation or the process.	
53:16.8 - 53:18.8	T3NL: No, I would love to translate more Vonnegut.	
53:21.4 - 53:21.7	Interviewer: me, too.	
53:23.3 - 53:25.7	T3NL: I just like never thought I would translate.	
53:25.7 - 53:29.4	T3NL: Good one good one, this was so much fun so.	
53:29.5 - 53:31.6	Interviewer: You should propose this to a publisher.	
53:31.9 - 53:37.1	T3NL: yeah perhaps, but this is like from a series of short stories.	
53:38.1 - 53:41.6	T3NL: Okay, so yeah I might propose.	
53:41.7 - 53:45.2	Interviewer: That appeared first individually in our magazine.	
53:45.5 - 53:51.4	Interviewer: And then, as part of a book that is called I tell you now and.	
53:56.2 - 53:58.2	Interviewer: Because I was writing this.	
53:59.6 - 54:01.6	Interviewer: I could have lost it already.	
54:05.4 - 54:05.8	here.	
54:08.0 - 54:08.5	Interviewer: So.	
54:10.9 - 54:16.4	Interviewer: So now respect of the collection bagombo snuff box, let me put this.	
54:17.3 - 54:18.8	Interviewer: One yeah.	
54:18.8 - 54:20.4	T3NL: I know it's not books.	
54:20.6 - 54:22.8	Interviewer: that's that's Vonnegut for you.	
54:24.4 - 54:25.5	Interviewer: So this this.	
54:28.1 - 54:30.0	T3NL: Oh yeah yeah.	
54:30.8 - 54:34.0	Interviewer: So i'm going to stop them the recording okay.	
54:36.0 - 54:37.3	T3NL: Magombo snuff box.
