0:03.2 - 0:16.6	Interviewer: Okay, so I wanted to ask you if you could give me a general view what you were saying earlier, a general view of the texts that you reviewed.	
0:19.2 - 0:21.7	R1CA: By general impression with the texts, was that	
0:22.8 - 0:23.6	R1CA: One of them.	
0:24.8 - 0:27.7	R1CA: In one of them you felt very comfortable when reading it.	
0:29.1 - 0:36.7	R1CA: You could tell that it was a high quality translation you one could read that text in a very fluent way.	
0:38.5 - 0:48.3	R1CA: Then there was a middle way text a text that we could text we could we could place between the two extremes, so to speak.	
0:49.3 - 0:53.5	R1CA: You could read the text quite easily. But then you	
0:54.5 - 1:02.1	R1CA: From time to time you stumbled upon things upon expressions or whatever that made you uncomfortable that you	
1:03.8 - 1:16.6	R1CA: You thought that that was not the right expression in Catalan. And then the third text was quite difficult to read. I mean, you have the impression that	
1:19.8 - 1:26.3	R1CA: A large scale intervention was necessary to to turn it into a readable text so	
1:27.5 - 1:28.5	R1CA: There were three points.	
1:28.6 - 1:30.1	R1CA: Three points right miss	
1:30.4 - 1:34.6	Interviewer: Do you recall which text their letters. Do you recall	
1:35.1 - 1:36.9	Interviewer: Which texts worse, which	
1:37.0 - 1:42.4	R1CA: Right, if I remember rightly, but I'm not sure about this, I would have to look at them again.	
1:45.5 - 1:49.2	R1CA: I think text A was the middle one.	
1:50.6 - 1:59.5	R1CA: Text B was the one that needed most intervention most corrections and Text C was the	
2:00.7 - 2:02.9	R1CA: Most fluent one, but I cannot recall	
2:03.3 - 2:04.5	R1CA: Okay, from memory.	
2:05.2 - 2:07.5	Interviewer: So this text B	
2:08.8 - 2:15.4	Interviewer: That needed a lot of intervention. Did you think this is machine translation.	
2:17.6 - 2:25.4	R1CA: Well, I didn't want to think in those terms because I know that you were probably interested in me not thinking in those terms.	
2:25.7 - 2:29.5	R1CA: But after some time. You just can't help it.	
2:29.7 - 2:33.9	R1CA: I mean, you tend to think that this could be machine translation.	
2:35.5 - 2:35.9	R1CA: With	
2:37.2 - 2:41.8	R1CA: With some post editing, maybe I wasn't sure about that.	
2:43.7 - 2:51.8	Interviewer: So you were not 100% sure if it was MT raw MT without in any post editing.	
2:52.0 - 2:54.0	R1CA: No, it wasn't. No.	
2:54.4 - 2:58.9	Interviewer: So you thought maybe some post-editing was done on it like	
3:01.0 - 3:10.4	R1CA: Even though at some points you felt sure that nobody had edited the the text, but there were other points where the text could be	
3:11.7 - 3:13.7	R1CA: Could be read more or less fluently as well.	
3:14.6 - 3:27.0	Interviewer: Oh, interesting, because this text B was raw machine translation. It wasn't edited. Does that surprise you?	
3:29.8 - 3:46.2	R1CA: Well, not really. It could be either either of the two possibilities. But as I said, you, you, you came upon things that you came. You came upon solutions that you thought that had to be raw machine translation. For instance, the, what was that the	
3:49.5 - 3:52.4	R1CA: Those different ways of referring to	
3:54.3 - 3:56.1	R1CA: The facility that facility.	
3:56.4 - 3:58.3	R1CA: nicknames for disposed off.	
4:00.4 - 4:01.1	Interviewer: Yeah.	
4:02.0 - 4:05.5	R1CA: What was the Orthodox name. Do you remember I know	
4:06.8 - 4:08.4	Interviewer: The Bureau of Termination?	
4:08.6 - 4:12.4	R1CA: You know, the bureau of termination. But the place. This is	
4:12.6 - 4:13.9	Interviewer: The gas chambers?	
4:14.1 - 4:15.7	R1CA: The studios.	
4:16.6 - 4:20.1	R1CA: The Orthodox ways of the offer those way of referring to them was the	
4:20.8 - 4:22.1	R1CA: Something studios.	
4:22.4 - 4:24.5	Interviewer: But anyway, this them.	
4:25.7 - 4:26.7	Interviewer: I tell you now	
4:27.4 - 4:33.2	R1CA: But there were many popular ways of referring to, to that sort of institution.	
4:34.0 - 4:34.5	Interviewer: Yeah.	
4:34.6 - 4:38.0	R1CA: Then Catbox, the cat box and so forth.	
4:39.1 - 4:42.1	Interviewer: So there is where you realize they were	
4:42.3 - 4:45.5	R1CA: Stumbled were when I stumbled upon that I fought that	
4:45.9 - 4:53.0	R1CA: That had to be raw machine translation, because it hadn't been altered had been left standing in English.	
4:53.6 - 4:53.9	Interviewer: That's	
4:54.4 - 5:01.9	R1CA: That's something you wouldn't have expected in our, you know, human translation or even in a post edited machine translation.	
5:04.9 - 5:07.1	Interviewer: Okay, so	
5:08.5 - 5:13.6	Interviewer: In you, you mentioned that between the text and	
5:14.6 - 5:16.3	Interviewer: A and C.	
5:18.3 - 5:21.3	Interviewer: There were then the two better texts.	
5:22.4 - 5:29.9	Interviewer: But there was a difference between them. Yes. Can you explain a little bit what was the difference	
5:32.2 - 5:43.4	R1CA: I would express the difference in terms of creativity of really creative solutions you came across these creative solutions in text C, especially	
5:45.8 - 5:48.5	R1CA: I mean solutions that you wouldn't have expected.	
5:50.0 - 6:11.4	R1CA: If a human translator would hadn't been involved. So it's the kind of solution that you would expect when a human translators involved and and I would add a very competent translator, because there were some solutions that were, you know, difficult to imagine	
6:12.6 - 6:15.3	R1CA: If, if a very good translator was not involved.	
6:16.4 - 6:19.0	Interviewer: Can you recall any of these solutions?	
6:21.4 - 6:23.2	R1CA: Well, that's the problem, as I told you I mean he	
6:24.7 - 6:31.9	R1CA: Had he had a text before me. I could. I'm sure I could point to some of these brilliant solutions, but not not from memory.	
6:32.2 - 6:33.3	Interviewer: Do you want to see them?	
6:33.9 - 6:34.6	R1CA: Oh, yes, of course.	
6:36.0 - 6:39.5	Interviewer: And also I want to	
6:42.8 - 6:52.6	Interviewer: Ask you, do you remember you had to classify that units of creative potential between this text A	
6:53.0 - 7:07.9	Interviewer: Yes, and C. But when you did. So this is just a comment, the number of creative solutions in Text C and Text A are exactly the same.	
7:08.6 - 7:14.0	Interviewer: Other yeah so text C has	
7:15.1 - 7:17.6	Interviewer: 72 out of the	
7:19.2 - 7:32.9	Interviewer: Out of the seven 185 units you might 72 in Text C for example as being creative and text a	
7:35.8 - 7:39.4	Interviewer: You also mark and	
7:41.2 - 7:42.9	Interviewer: You also mark 72	
7:44.4 - 7:50.2	Interviewer: So I thought that was curious since you just told me then.	
7:51.8 - 7:53.9	R1CA: Yeah, it was more creative.	
7:54.9 - 7:57.5	R1CA: That comes that comes as a bit of a surprise.	
7:59.5 - 8:04.2	R1CA: And I'm not, I'm not really sure what the reason for that may be	
8:05.3 - 8:14.4	Interviewer: Could it be that the solutions that you provide that were provided in Text C were more to your liking even say for example,	
8:15.5 - 8:19.0	Interviewer: The title "to be or not to be" is	
8:20.9 - 8:31.0	Interviewer: Similar in both texts. Right. So both you you classified both of them as modification	
8:31.3 - 8:35.2	Interviewer: Yeah, but maybe you prefer one more than the other?	
8:37.0 - 8:42.7	R1CA: Well, I can't remember the details now, but I think, I seem to remember. They were very similar	
8:43.2 - 8:53.1	R1CA: Yeah. The title is very, was very similar, there were there were more differences across the solutions for the for the name of these institution. I was mentioning	
8:53.1 - 8:57.6	R1CA: Before the cat box and and all that sort of thing.	
8:59.3 - 9:06.3	R1CA: And some of the solutions provided for for that in in text C, we're really	
9:09.0 - 9:11.3	R1CA: Were really brilliant in the sense that	
9:12.9 - 9:15.7	R1CA: The translator had made a I think	
9:17.0 - 9:18.2	R1CA: A big effort	
9:18.7 - 9:20.2	Interviewer: Can you see this screen.	
9:20.7 - 9:21.0	Yeah.	
9:22.5 - 9:24.8	Interviewer: So here	
9:26.8 - 9:35.8	Interviewer: Are the solutions Automat, Autoservei, Envassadora, Llemenera, Sortida fàcil, Últim petó.	
9:39.7 - 9:43.2	Interviewer: And the solutions in A are these ones	
9:45.2 - 9:46.6	Interviewer: All right, this was	
9:49.9 - 9:50.1	No.	
9:55.6 - 10:01.3	R1CA: Yeah, for instance, Minipimer is maybe more graphic than just Batedora.	
10:02.6 - 10:07.5	R1CA: Because it's a it's a trademark and we are very familiar with with with a name, Minipimer	
10:08.0 - 10:10.2	R1CA: Mm hmm. Or	
10:13.1 - 10:14.0	R1CA: I think the other one was	
10:15.6 - 10:16.9	R1CA: was Bany de suarda...	
10:18.4 - 10:21.0	R1CA: Is A or C, this is a	
10:22.4 - 10:25.8	Interviewer: Let me show you all this is a	
10:28.7 - 10:29.6	Interviewer: So,	
10:32.0 - 10:35.1	Interviewer: Let me find it here. Yeah, so	
10:41.0 - 10:42.0	Interviewer: This is C	
10:43.2 - 10:45.4	Interviewer: Let me show also everything	
10:49.1 - 10:58.8	R1CA: Yeah, things like Bany de Suarda or Minipimer where maybe more unpredictable in this, in this context, then the, the solution is provided by	
11:00.3 - 11:02.1	R1CA: The person responsible for text A, I would say	
11:02.7 - 11:09.7	Interviewer: Here the translation for Sheepdip is Desparasitadora. Yeah.	
11:11.1 - 11:14.3	Interviewer: And here it is Bany de Suarda.	
11:18.0 - 11:20.0	Interviewer: Why do you think this is better.	
11:20.6 - 11:24.6	R1CA: Yeah, I think this is better. Yeah, and it is more unpredictable and	
11:27.5 - 11:37.0	R1CA: I think the translator has taken,  has taken a longer time has has invested more effort in order to to reach that solution. I think	
11:39.1 - 11:39.8	Interviewer: Okay.	
11:40.9 - 11:45.6	R1CA: I mean, he or she has not settled for for the first thing that has crossed his or her mind.	
11:46.8 - 11:47.4	Interviewer: Okay.	
11:48.2 - 11:51.6	R1CA: Which is probably not the case in the other text either, but	
11:54.2 - 11:57.7	R1CA: This one has been more more self demanding, so to speak.	
11:58.2 - 11:59.0	Okay.	
12:02.0 - 12:03.5	Interviewer: Also em.	
12:05.0 - 12:06.2	Interviewer: The	
12:07.8 - 12:08.4	Interviewer: There was	
12:09.5 - 12:12.4	Interviewer: Of course, you were reviewing but	
12:13.6 - 12:22.4	Interviewer: What would you say that the translators had to be more creative. One is this the nicknames. Right.	
12:23.6 - 12:26.2	Interviewer: Where else do you think they had to be more creative.	
12:29.8 - 12:30.1	Interviewer: Oh,	
12:31.7 - 12:53.6	R1CA: Will you see translation quality is not always a matter of creativity that there's, there are many translation problems in this text, which have to do with fluency, which have to do with register, adequacy and other matters, for instance, as regards the use of tú or vosté.	
12:54.3 - 12:54.5	R1CA: Yeah.	
12:54.9 - 12:55.8	R1CA: One of the two	
12:57.4 - 12:57.8	R1CA: Would	
12:59.4 - 13:05.3	R1CA: Second Person personal pronoun. I think that the use	
13:06.3 - 13:13.2	R1CA: Made of these pronouns in Text C more adequate then the one made in Text A	
13:14.5 - 13:15.4	R1CA: Credible i mean	
13:16.9 - 13:17.9	R1CA: You can imagine	
13:19.6 - 13:27.9	R1CA: People in in a real situation using tú or vosté in the way that the translator of Text C does	
13:29.7 - 13:47.1	Interviewer: In text  a there was only one part where I think the gender was different. Sorry the treatment was different, which is the part where the painter meets Leonara Duncan.	
13:48.2 - 13:52.3	Interviewer: In one text it is tú and in the other text is vosté.	
13:53.4 - 13:59.6	Interviewer: Are you referring to this because I think that the rest is quite similar the treatment.	
14:02.5 - 14:13.8	R1CA: Again, I don't remember the details, but I do remember that there were differences. It may be the situation may be the one that you're referring to when the, when the painter.	
14:15.3 - 14:16.3	R1CA: Yeah, when the	
14:17.9 - 14:25.1	R1CA: Or maybe when the yeah when when this hospital orderly meets the painter.	
14:25.5 - 14:26.1	Yeah.	
14:28.4 - 14:29.2	R1CA: What happened then	
14:30.8 - 14:32.4	R1CA: I think, I think the painter.	
14:33.8 - 14:37.6	R1CA: Uses tú with the with the orderly	
14:38.0 - 14:39.7	R1CA: Yeah, which is	
14:41.1 - 14:45.0	R1CA: Which is. All right. Anything because he's supposed to be younger	
14:47.1 - 14:51.4	R1CA: And then when they when this with this young woman comes along.	
14:55.8 - 14:59.1	R1CA: I don't remember now. But I think that	
15:00.2 - 15:02.6	Interviewer: Let me show you	
15:05.8 - 15:07.2	R1CA: What was the name of this woman.	
15:07.6 - 15:08.1	Duncan.	
15:09.1 - 15:10.4	R1CA: Duncan. That's right.	
15:13.3 - 15:14.2	Interviewer: And	
15:16.8 - 15:25.0	Interviewer: How was that, do you recall how was the treatment in the machine translated text or you can text that was worse text B	
15:26.9 - 15:28.6	R1CA: I think it was	
15:29.8 - 15:30.7	R1CA: If he was tú	
15:32.1 - 15:33.0	Interviewer: All the way.	
15:33.0 - 15:44.6	R1CA: That case. I can't remember now. What they did was systematic. I mean, all through the text, but at that particular point when when Duncan meets the painter. I think they used tú	
15:45.7 - 15:46.3	R1CA: In text B	
15:47.7 - 15:50.6	R1CA: And I seem to remember in text a as well.	
15:52.5 - 15:54.6	Interviewer: Okay, this is text a	
15:57.2 - 15:58.6	Interviewer: So here	
16:01.6 - 16:06.2	Interviewer: Hey, the celador arrives and	
16:16.5 - 16:20.3	Interviewer: And they treat each other. Yeah.	
16:21.3 - 16:22.3	R1CA: They both of use tú	
16:22.6 - 16:23.4	R1CA: Com veus tú la vida real?	
16:24.8 - 16:25.3	R1CA: Va voler saber el celador.	
16:26.1 - 16:28.1	Interviewer: And then then	
16:30.4 - 16:31.0	Interviewer: The woman.	
16:32.6 - 16:32.8	Interviewer: Yeah.	
16:35.0 - 16:40.2	R1CA: And the woman, even if she's younger, I think that the fact that they don't know each other.	
16:41.2 - 16:51.6	R1CA: Ought to have imposed some sort of social distance. I think they would be more credible in Catalan and that they should they both should have used vosté	
16:52.3 - 16:55.6	Interviewer: Mm hmm. Or maybe their ranking in	
16:57.4 - 16:57.6	It.	
16:58.7 - 17:02.6	Interviewer: Because she's from a superior rank in theory, right.	
17:04.3 - 17:07.4	Interviewer: But then it's it's all	
17:08.4 - 17:18.7	R1CA: Yeah, but you know these things happen in reality. I mean, you could you could take two or three published translations of the same source text and come across different solutions for that for that for this.	
17:21.3 - 17:24.9	Interviewer: And there was another difference between text B	
17:26.0 - 17:26.7	Interviewer: and A	
17:27.9 - 17:37.0	Interviewer: That the names were translated in text A but in Text B were not	
17:37.7 - 17:40.7	R1CA: I think Afflick was translated in text a	
17:41.4 - 17:42.0	Mm hmm.	
17:43.2 - 17:43.6	Interviewer: Yeah.	
17:44.0 - 17:49.5	R1CA: Whereas Duncan was not and in Text C. See, I think it was the other the other way around.	
17:49.6 - 17:52.4	R1CA: Yeah, Duncan was translated as	
17:55.8 - 17:56.1	Interviewer: Pelham	
17:57.3 - 18:00.6	R1CA: Pelham. Yeah, that's right. I thought that the brilliant very brilliant solution.	
18:02.4 - 18:04.2	Interviewer: And Affleck, not so	
18:04.3 - 18:09.4	R1CA: An Affleck, maybe not so maybe for for an average reader.	
18:10.6 - 18:13.5	R1CA: Discerning would not be a	
18:15.1 - 18:17.7	R1CA: Elusive, so to speak, immediately.	
18:18.3 - 18:28.3	R1CA: I'm not sure. It could be, but I'm not sure about that. Whereas in Pelham it's a very brilliant solution for for Duncan. No.	
18:29.2 - 18:45.2	Interviewer: Okay, so this is another question I had. And what do you think people reading the text this A, B and C. What do you think their experience will be	
18:50.3 - 18:56.5	R1CA: Well as a reader. I would like this Pelham solution, no doubt about that. I mean,	
18:58.2 - 19:10.2	R1CA: I know not sure about Affleck, but then not not just as a reader. But does that say a translation scholar and translate a trainer and so on. I have my doubts about that. I mean, if	
19:11.5 - 19:15.0	R1CA: I'm not very keen on on changing names.	
19:17.1 - 19:20.5	R1CA: proper names and surnames, and that sort of thing.	
19:21.7 - 19:23.9	R1CA: Well, of course, in this, in both cases.	
19:25.2 - 19:36.7	R1CA: Both translators have managed to preserve verisimilitude, so to speak, because the surnames sound English so they haven't resorted to using	
19:37.6 - 19:47.3	R1CA: Certain names which might have clashed with with the context of situation in there. I mean, for instance, Catalan sounding or Spanish sounding or whatever.	
19:49.4 - 19:50.6	Interviewer: Yeah, they didn't go for	
19:50.7 - 19:50.9	Me.	
19:53.1 - 19:53.8	R1CA: In general,	
19:53.8 - 20:00.0	R1CA: In general terms, I'm not, I'm not sure. And in very often. I'm not very keen on that these sort of solution.	
20:01.3 - 20:09.4	R1CA: But I must, I must, I must acknowledge that in these cases, especially in the Pelham case, the solution is	
20:10.9 - 20:13.2	R1CA: Well, I like it. I think it is brilliant	
20:14.3 - 20:14.8	Interviewer: The	
20:17.3 - 20:28.9	Interviewer: Well, I imagine if they were to go with Catalan names that we need to change locations and they would need to make it all kind of more local	
20:30.7 - 20:37.6	Interviewer: But this story could work with could work properly in any country just need to be	
20:39.6 - 20:41.1	Interviewer: In the States, but that would be	
20:42.5 - 20:50.2	Interviewer: Full domestication, so they have the in this case Pelham or Affleck, they have chosen the	
20:51.3 - 20:52.1	Interviewer: The middle route.	
20:52.5 - 20:52.6	Yeah.	
20:54.0 - 21:04.9	Interviewer: But do you think that the readers of these texts, especially text a and see. Do you think they will appreciate these differences.	
21:08.3 - 21:09.2	R1CA: Well, I hope so.	
21:11.3 - 21:12.5	Interviewer: I will let you know.	
21:13.3 - 21:14.3	Interviewer: But then	
21:14.6 - 21:21.9	R1CA: As as a as a as a reader. I can tell you that I did appreciate both solutions and especially the Pelham one	
21:23.0 - 21:32.1	R1CA: And but of course I'm not an average reader in that I'm also a translator and I'm used to looking behind the scenes and	
21:32.1 - 21:34.2	R1CA: knowing what is going on there.	
21:35.7 - 21:38.2	R1CA: But yeah, I mean sort of	
21:42.6 - 21:49.2	R1CA: A sharp very sharp breather a minimally sharp reader would be able to to enjoy that solution. I think	
21:49.6 - 21:50.1	Mm hmm.	
21:52.3 - 21:56.2	Interviewer: Regarding the number of errors in the translations.	
21:57.6 - 22:01.7	Interviewer: Text C had the least number of errors.	
22:03.4 - 22:13.9	Interviewer: And do you recall a little bit the type of errors that you saw or because there was quite a big difference between	
22:15.3 - 22:19.9	Interviewer: Between the two that the three texts obviously number B had.	
22:20.9 - 22:25.0	Interviewer: A lot of errors and one	
22:28.3 - 22:31.4	Interviewer: 301	
22:33.9 - 22:47.6	Interviewer: But text A had 63 errors of which a 38 were real errors. The other 24 where you mentioned preferential that you would rather use the other translation.	
22:48.7 - 22:51.1	Interviewer: And in the in Text C	
22:54.8 - 22:55.8	Interviewer: There were	
22:58.5 - 23:10.6	Interviewer: 19 errors of which at 15 were errors. So there is a huge difference between text C an A.	
23:13.3 - 23:15.4	Interviewer: And I was wondering about that.	
23:19.0 - 23:20.3	Interviewer: Do you recall	
23:22.1 - 23:26.5	Interviewer: There were some errors that were to do with punctuation.	
23:27.8 - 23:28.8	Interviewer: The formatting.	
23:30.0 - 23:31.2	Interviewer: Of the dash	
23:32.2 - 23:42.9	Interviewer: But mainly it's just awkward or or grammatical register some mistranslations.	
23:44.2 - 23:44.5	R1CA: Yeah.	
23:46.0 - 23:48.2	R1CA: Well, you see that the borderline between	
23:49.2 - 23:56.1	R1CA: A real era. And what I would call an inadequacy is not so clear as it as it seems, and	
23:58.0 - 23:59.5	R1CA: Probably from	
24:00.6 - 24:03.5	R1CA: From habit I tend to	
24:04.5 - 24:28.6	R1CA: Improve anything that I think is improvable so in this in this text A I imagine that some some stretches of text might might have been left untouched, but I couldn't, I couldn't really help myself. I had to whenever I thought that the text could be improved. I just did it and	
24:30.1 - 24:38.1	R1CA: I wouldn't say that in all these cases, what I came across in the translation was really an error, this is this is a big doubt that I had	
24:39.7 - 24:48.5	R1CA: Since you told me to. Since you since you encouraged me to intervene whenever possible. Whenever I thought it was	
24:48.8 - 24:49.3	Interviewer: Well, I	
24:49.3 - 24:50.0	I	
24:51.2 - 24:53.6	Interviewer: All the reviewers to correct the text.	
24:54.0 - 24:55.2	Interviewer: To be published.	
24:55.3 - 24:58.0	Interviewer: Yeah, so the text could be published.	
24:58.1 - 24:59.8	R1CA: So that's, that's what I did to	
25:01.0 - 25:08.5	R1CA: What in from my from my point of view, was solutions that improved the original formulation	
25:09.4 - 25:18.1	Interviewer: And these are the texts that you mark and these are the errors that you mark as neutral, the ones that were mirror improvements.	
25:20.7 - 25:27.6	R1CA: Know what I mark as neutral is, if I remember rightly, those errors which had already been marked before	
25:28.0 - 25:32.3	R1CA: Okay, look, so that they wouldn't sort of distort the, the final count.	
25:32.7 - 25:37.4	Interviewer: Okay okay okay because and	
25:37.6 - 25:39.4	R1CA: Text, wasn't that your idea, Anna.	
25:39.7 - 25:49.1	Interviewer: Yes. Yeah, it could be, but it could also be that you mark neutral according to the instructions, something that you say, well, here you could use tú	
25:49.6 - 26:07.2	Interviewer: Or vosté but I would prefer vosté, but it's not an error is it could be a translation and you can see even the logic in using to buy you prefer to stay. That would be neutral for me and I thought you mark some of those as neutral or not.	
26:07.7 - 26:09.0	R1CA: Maybe, maybe in	
26:09.9 - 26:20.3	Interviewer: And so I wanted to tell you that text A and C was translated were translated by the same translators.	
26:23.4 - 26:29.2	Interviewer: But one was from scratch. And the other one was post-edited.	
26:29.6 - 26:31.2	R1CA: Oh really, so the same person.	
26:31.3 - 26:33.3	Interviewer: The same two people.	
26:33.8 - 26:36.2	Interviewer: Yeah, they did half and half.	
26:36.6 - 26:44.1	Interviewer: Okay, so one started with nothing like like the previous experiment.	
26:44.6 - 26:58.1	Interviewer: The first half was empty, and the second half was translated and the other person. The first half was post-edited, and then we put together the post editing one	
26:58.6 - 26:59.9	Interviewer: And the human in one	
27:00.5 - 27:02.8	Interviewer: So, which one would you say	
27:03.9 - 27:10.4	Interviewer: Is is the post edited version and which one do you say is the human translation after what I have explained	
27:11.8 - 27:24.0	R1CA: I would say that A is the post edited version, B as you said is the the machine translation and C is the text translated from scratch.	
27:24.5 - 27:25.8	Interviewer: And why would you say that	
27:28.2 - 27:31.2	R1CA: I would say that because, um,	
27:35.0 - 27:42.4	R1CA: Well, because I've been a subject in these experiments as well, in part, and I know that when your post editing, you are	
27:43.6 - 27:48.2	R1CA: Primed or conditioned by what you, what you have before you	
27:49.5 - 28:00.6	R1CA: I mean, you of course you intervene, of course, you change things, of course you rewrite a lot but not to the same extent. So, so that the target text.	
28:02.0 - 28:07.8	R1CA: Can cannot be as different from the source text as it would be if you translate it from scratch.	
28:09.0 - 28:19.7	R1CA: Mm hmm. That's what I found. I mean, in text C. You, you, you came across that sort of solution that you would only you would only have if you translate it from from scratch. That's, that's what I think.	
28:21.2 - 28:27.2	Interviewer: Yeah okay and you are right that that was the case. So	
28:28.7 - 28:33.8	Interviewer: Text a was post-edited, B was raw MT empty and C was human	
28:35.0 - 28:38.8	Interviewer: A also I think in this case.	
28:41.0 - 28:46.1	Interviewer: We had two there were two translators that two different approaches as well.	
28:47.6 - 28:49.0	Interviewer: So if	
28:50.7 - 28:55.8	Interviewer: I'm not sure about that. But if the first part.	
28:57.2 - 28:59.3	Interviewer: Was the human translation.	
29:00.8 - 29:08.0	Interviewer: Maybe that also conditioned the translator. So the translator, that had to start with post editing.	
29:10.2 - 29:12.7	Interviewer: Maybe then he's human translation.	
29:14.2 - 29:18.8	Interviewer: Was not as good as if it had a start with a human translation, if you know what I mean.	
29:19.0 - 29:21.9	R1CA: Yes, I see what you mean	
29:22.1 - 29:36.6	Interviewer: Bad this translator was in Text C. So both were in both right and but some of the solutions that you have mentioned are from one of the translators.	
29:39.1 - 29:39.7	R1CA: So, so this	
29:39.8 - 29:40.3	This	
29:41.8 - 29:55.6	R1CA: This way of proceeding probably accounts for for the fact that, for instance, the TV pronounced the, the second, the second person personal pronouns are used differently across the two hops in text A	
29:57.8 - 30:02.9	Interviewer: Not really, because there was a change and	
30:05.1 - 30:18.8	Interviewer: Even in in the in the original post-edited and that is because you will see, but we had to, if the dialogue was split we unify I unified the dialogue so	
30:20.5 - 30:23.2	Interviewer: So then the resulting pieces were	
30:25.2 - 30:37.9	Interviewer: So for example in text A the dialogue that was cut in the middle. The first part of the dialogue was tú. And the second part of the dialogue was vosté.	
30:38.5 - 30:54.5	Interviewer: And in text a the first part was vosté. And the second part was tú. So we unified this too. And that's why, now it's different, but we did it based on the number of times that he was present	
30:54.9 - 31:06.3	Interviewer: Okay, okay. So basically the weight of one translator, the decisions made by one translator and may be heavier in one than the other.	
31:06.7 - 31:08.0	Interviewer: You know what I mean. Okay.	
31:11.1 - 31:14.9	Interviewer: So yeah, it's risky the methodology, I guess.	
31:18.2 - 31:23.5	Interviewer: So the other question that I had was that	
31:24.9 - 31:25.8	Interviewer: And	
31:27.8 - 31:34.3	Interviewer: If you you had a look at text B and it had a lot of errors.	
31:35.9 - 31:45.1	Interviewer: How do you think machine translation can be used to work with literary texts. So rather than	
31:46.8 - 31:51.2	Interviewer: How can it improve to work with literary texts.	
31:52.2 - 31:56.0	Interviewer: How would you like to save us, if at all, maybe not.	
31:59.6 - 32:10.4	R1CA: Well when you when you're confronted with a results, you almost wish that it wasn't used at all because once you see the once you see the text C	
32:10.8 - 32:22.6	R1CA: And once you know that it has been translated by well in this case since you've told me by two human translators, you cannot help prefering these version to the to the previous two, I think.	
32:25.4 - 32:26.9	R1CA: But answering your question.	
32:28.1 - 32:43.0	R1CA: Maybe a machine translation could be useful in the sense that it could save time for those stretches in a text in a narrative text that are more or less mechanic. I mean,	
32:44.2 - 32:56.9	R1CA: When, when people when people say things when people ask or answer or when people do things with their bodies such as frown or shrugged or whatever	
32:58.5 - 33:12.9	R1CA: And that happens very often in narrative pieces or when there are just, you know, with it is language that is denotational that has no connotations at all. Somebody got up and left.	
33:14.2 - 33:20.9	R1CA: The sun. The sun was shining or the sun rose at seven o'clock in the morning, things like that. I think that	
33:23.0 - 33:27.4	R1CA: Machine translation can be used safely and it	
33:29.0 - 33:29.9	R1CA: It could save time	
33:31.4 - 33:37.0	R1CA: So if you were using machine translation as an aid with your word processor	
33:38.2 - 33:43.4	R1CA: You would have that done. I mean, you, you wouldn't have to do it yourself. You have to	
33:45.2 - 33:52.9	R1CA: type the words or whatever. But there would be already on the screen because the machine would have done it.	
33:54.2 - 34:00.4	R1CA: That's the only way I envisage envisage right now in which machine translation could be	
34:02.3 - 34:04.3	R1CA: Of help to literate translators.	
34:04.8 - 34:22.3	Interviewer: So basically, if we look at the classification that you use for units of creative potential when there is a reproduction. That is clear it's useful, but if there is any creativity, then you're better off with a blank slate	
34:22.9 - 34:35.9	R1CA: It's not only a matter of creativity. It's also a matter of, as I said, of adequacy in terms of register in terms of syntax. There are there are many things at stake. Well, of course you are aware of that as well as me.	
34:41.1 - 34:42.7	R1CA: There's a whole bunch of things that	
34:43.7 - 34:48.7	R1CA: I don't think the the machine is prepared to to do right now.	
34:50.0 - 34:50.6	Interviewer: So,	
34:52.6 - 35:14.4	Interviewer: Parts of the texts that are more complex that the literary translator has a lot of options in their head. And as I have heard a Dutch translator mentioned you create a world on your head. And from there you choose right now.	
35:15.5 - 35:20.8	Interviewer: Is there any way that an aid. Let's not call it machine translation or	
35:22.4 - 35:31.8	Interviewer: A technical aid could help with those stretches of the texts, where you need to look at options in your head.	
35:38.3 - 35:44.8	R1CA: Well, I don't think so. I mean, beyond, beyond this kind of stretches of text. I was referring to a minute ago.	
35:48.6 - 35:55.3	R1CA: I don't know how others but in my experience, I like to engage with the text into	
35:58.5 - 36:08.2	R1CA: To get into the world into the fictional world that I am reproducing and I like to have full control over what I'm producing	
36:09.0 - 36:17.2	R1CA: So I don't see. I don't see many ways in which the machine would help me apart from what i would i mentioned before. I mean, those, those stretches, which are	
36:20.8 - 36:23.7	R1CA: Which are straightforward, in the sense that	
36:25.1 - 36:28.2	R1CA: You can only imagine one way of translating them.	
36:31.0 - 36:31.6	Interviewer: Okay.	
36:32.8 - 36:38.7	Interviewer: And do you think that and they use of machine translation.	
36:40.7 - 36:46.4	Interviewer: For example, in this case, you had a text B, you had a proposal.	
36:47.7 - 36:52.1	Interviewer: Is that proposal better than than not having a proposal in Catalan	
36:56.2 - 37:17.2	Interviewer: So, what I mean is for language pairs that might not get translated at all in your language. In this case, Catalan, is MT, does MT  has a function for people to get to know that pace to to read that offer	
37:23.5 - 37:36.2	R1CA: Well, I suppose so I mean if if there is no chance that it takes we be translated into catalan of course machine translation will be better if you're talking about that is that is that your question.	
37:36.3 - 37:45.7	R1CA: Is what is referring to. I mean, if there is no chance that a publisher will be interested in in translating a text from, say, from	
37:46.0 - 37:47.6	Interviewer: Slovak, yeah.	
37:48.3 - 37:54.0	R1CA: Or whatever, then, of course, yeah of course machine translation would be better than nothing. And you could	
37:55.2 - 37:56.1	R1CA: You could form.	
37:57.7 - 38:05.6	R1CA: Yeah, definitely. I mean, you could form a general idea if if if I only had text B not C or A I could	
38:06.9 - 38:12.2	R1CA: Definitely know what this piece of fiction is about and	
38:13.7 - 38:15.9	R1CA: I would, of course, notice that	
38:17.3 - 38:24.2	R1CA: The text was not the ideal one, but I could form an idea. I could read it more or less fluently and	
38:27.1 - 38:34.5	R1CA: Yeah, I mean it could it could work with all those limitations that I'm referring to. But it could work. Why not. Yeah.	
38:35.9 - 38:42.6	Interviewer: So for for for less languages, lesser is not the word and	
38:43.4 - 38:44.1	R1CA: Lesser known	
38:44.5 - 38:55.8	Interviewer: Lesser known exactly or language combinations, not even languages. So like you said Slovak Catalan, Macedonian Catalan, Romanian Catalan.	
38:57.3 - 38:59.8	Interviewer: Then MT might have a function	
39:00.9 - 39:08.5	R1CA: We use of course that's a having a machine translation that then not having any translation at all. Definitely. Yeah, I have no doubt about it.	
39:09.0 - 39:10.3	Interviewer: Okay, okay.	
39:11.7 - 39:14.4	Interviewer: Is there anything else that you would like to comment.	
39:15.8 - 39:24.3	R1CA: The only thing I know is that I now regret that these interviews should not have taken place closer to the task.	
39:24.8 - 39:32.9	R1CA: Yes, because some time has elapsed. Now, as you will probably have noticed the details were not fresh in my mind and	
39:34.8 - 39:38.2	Interviewer: There were the holidays, the Xmas holidays. That's the only problem.	
39:38.3 - 39:48.3	Interviewer: The Christmas holiday. So I didn't want to disturb their viewers. Then the next ones are closer	
39:48.8 - 40:01.2	R1CA: I don't think it's a disturbance. Because once once you've completed the task, you of course you're prepared if you're if you've if you've devoted maybe 18 or 20 hours even more to the task, then you can easily devote	
40:02.8 - 40:07.0	R1CA: Half an hour or even an hour full hour to a nice chat with you.	
40:07.1 - 40:07.7	Interviewer: I mean, if	
40:09.1 - 40:11.1	R1CA: There's no problem at all, and	
40:12.2 - 40:14.4	R1CA: The impressions would have been fresh on my mind.	
40:14.8 - 40:19.5	Interviewer: Yeah, no, not to worry sometimes also when...	
40:21.0 - 40:22.9	Interviewer: When time elapses	
40:23.9 - 40:27.3	Interviewer: Something happens. I think as well that you distill the	
40:28.5 - 40:31.0	Interviewer: Most important ideas.	
40:32.1 - 40:35.0	Interviewer: Okay. But anyway, the other ones. I know.	
40:36.0 - 40:43.2	Interviewer: The recent holiday in between. So the other ones will take place closer so I'm going to stop the recording.	
40:44.0 - 40:44.3	Okay.	
40:48.2 - 40:48.8	Interviewer: Yes.
