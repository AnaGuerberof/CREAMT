0:01.8 - 0:02.6	Interviewer: Good morning.	
0:03.4 - 0:04.1	R2CA:: Good morning.	
0:05.8 - 0:14.0	Interviewer: So I wanted to ask you if you could give me your general views or reviewing this texts.	
0:14.7 - 0:25.5	R2CA: Okay, I, I think it was, it was tricky. It was really tricky to to review those texts. I'm more used to translate than to to really want to proofread.	
0:25.9 - 0:34.2	R2CA: And especially in Catalan, which is my mother tongue, but I'm more used to translate and review into what in Spanish. So I'm always	
0:34.7 - 0:44.0	R2CA: second guessing myself, especially in terms of Valencian Catalan and the different variants that we have, because sometimes I think, oh, maybe this sounds weird, because it's not	
0:45.6 - 0:58.0	R2CA: The Catalan that we speak and writing Valencia and maybe it's it's a common variant  word or or vocabulary in it the other way around. So that makes made me a second guess myself. A lot of times	
0:58.4 - 1:04.9	R2CA: The text was also difficult to translate I admired a task that the translators did because it was	
1:05.8 - 1:13.8	R2CA: Not an easy text to translate it was really tricky in in demanded a lot of imagination of creativity to solve other problems.	
1:14.5 - 1:27.5	R2CA: And so when I had to, to review. Sometimes it was like, well, they did a great job but but that it was still difficult. So sometimes it was like, I don't know if I should mark days some steak or or not.	
1:29.1 - 1:41.1	R2CA: The in terms of, well, we could split the difficulty between the three texts and the first one, I think it was more or less.	
1:43.8 - 1:44.9	R2CA: How could I say it.	
1:45.9 - 1:57.5	R2CA: was difficult to review it, but not as much as the second one, which I guess it was the one that was a absolutely translated by the machine. So it was not difficult, but	
1:59.2 - 2:11.4	R2CA: Um, it took me a lot of time to mark all the mistakes because there were so many mistakes that it was like one again and again and again and again. And the third one for me was the best translation.	
2:12.4 - 2:22.0	R2CA: And it also made it made my life a little bit difficult because sometimes is like, wow, this is really good. And when I have to classify the in the part of	
2:22.6 - 2:41.3	R2CA: Creative sheets and all of these, these part was difficult for the third one, because sometimes it's difficult to enclose they get to enclose the creative shifts or the errors in one category or or another. So maybe in the future if I'm more used to use these categories and	
2:42.7 - 2:58.2	R2CA: Yes the categories and labels, it will make the job easier, but for the first one for the first time, and it was it was a bit complicated. I hope it is. Okay. And I put the things in the right category. Otherwise, you tell me and and I corrected again.	
3:00.4 - 3:12.4	Interviewer: Sometimes, there isn't a right or wrong category as you know in in translation, you know, an error, sometimes can be classified differently and	
3:13.7 - 3:26.3	Interviewer: The creative shifts as well. So the interesting part for us is to see this variance as well. I think most of you that reviewers.	
3:28.1 - 3:43.2	Interviewer: Would agree, probably on the number of errors or the creative shifts, but maybe the classification is different, but I think this happens right	
3:45.2 - 3:45.9	Interviewer: And	
3:48.3 - 3:53.2	Interviewer: I would be interested in knowing	
3:54.6 - 4:01.1	Interviewer: Which were in your opinion, the main difficulties of the text.	
4:01.9 - 4:05.4	Interviewer: Okay, because you did mention that it was very difficult.	
4:07.1 - 4:20.1	R2CA: On the one hand, I think the world of neologisms or was that demanded at total adaptation or a very different world in span, such as a title, for instance, yet to get the reference and to about that.	
4:20.7 - 4:32.7	R2CA: Then the telephone number. The name of the termination center and the cat box and all of these all of these terms that demanded to be to be creative and	
4:33.9 - 4:36.9	R2CA: The orality as well, which I think is always	
4:38.2 - 4:49.7	R2CA: Well, it depends on the translator for me. I love translating orality. So why, because I do audio visual translation as well. So for me, it's not normally a huge a problem but	
4:50.7 - 4:57.0	R2CA: I think that in this text. If you are not used to translate orality you could face some problems there until give these	
4:57.7 - 5:05.8	R2CA: Especially to mark different registers to mark different and temporal varieties. Now when when they use like more	
5:06.8 - 5:20.4	R2CA: Old Fashioned words are not like all good gravy and all of these all of these terms, you have to have this special sensibility for for for orality. So that could be another difficult point and in terms of style.	
5:23.0 - 5:41.0	R2CA: I think that in terms of style. It was a bit tricky sometimes to go beyond the English racing and to get this natural or these distinctive style that I that I found on the on the original on the original text, which I think is quite peculiar is not	
5:42.2 - 5:53.6	R2CA: A very traditional style with subject, verb, object point next sentence. It has some variants on terms of style. So that was also a difficult point. I think	
5:55.7 - 6:00.7	Interviewer: Em. You also mentioned that and	
6:02.7 - 6:24.3	Interviewer: That translators have to be creative. You said they have to use their imagination and be creative in this text and could you tell me where do you think they have to be more creative and what is creativity for you.	
6:24.7 - 6:26.4	Interviewer: Have a translation.	
6:26.7 - 6:28.0	R2CA: Okay, that's a difficult one.	
6:29.1 - 6:35.8	R2CA: Well, they had to be creative with the with the puns and the second of this is	
6:36.9 - 6:42.4	R2CA: The names that had double meanings and other prominent Leora Duncan that then we had this word play	
6:42.8 - 6:54.7	R2CA: Within the text and with the names that were given to the termination center with a title with the word game as well with a with a telephone number that demanded creativity, all these	
6:55.1 - 7:12.1	R2CA: Little puns inside inside the texts. Otherwise, that didn't work or not, as well as in the original which is very not I wouldn't say funny, but it has this double layer of of meaning looming over over the text then	
7:13.4 - 7:15.8	R2CA: Once seconds. I'll connect the battery.	
7:17.8 - 7:23.1	R2CA: That was a very important aspect or another, where they have to be creative and	
7:23.6 - 7:39.9	R2CA: As well. In orality, in orality, I think that's creativity is fundamental, because otherwise you get stuck to the English phrasing. And it doesn't sound natural. It doesn't sound real know it sounds like a translation and they have to be creative. Maybe in descriptions and	
7:41.4 - 7:44.7	R2CA: Depending on what you're describing, but there may be one second.	
7:51.0 - 7:58.6	R2CA: inspirations that been depending on the object or the landscape that you're describing, sometimes you don't need to be that creative because	
7:58.9 - 8:06.5	R2CA: The author has been creative for you has already used the the objectives that you need to use and you just will reproduce a bit	
8:06.8 - 8:17.4	R2CA: The, the image that the author is creating or has already created on the original text, but in orality you always need to give that input yourself because the author is not going to give you these	
8:18.1 - 8:27.5	R2CA: Well, no, this little sentences and natural phrasing that you will find in in Spanish and other points where you had to be creative.	
8:28.1 - 8:40.5	R2CA: And maybe not for the actual translation, but to imagine the world he is depicting because well is is realistic but he also has some dystopian or some imagined	
8:41.0 - 8:46.9	R2CA: Aspects now when he speaks about this and the mural that the painter is is painting or you have to	
8:47.6 - 8:52.8	R2CA: Imagine a little bit the wall, the object or or the picture that he's	
8:53.2 - 9:02.1	R2CA: He's describing because you don't have an actual reference I will maybe the hospital or the hospital room. You can imagine that, and you don't need to be creative, to create that image in your head.	
9:02.6 - 9:16.8	R2CA: And but in the ward, for instance, I think you have to be creative or imaginative in your mind to to see the image and to be able to to translate it, and what does it mean for me to be creative. That's a tricky one.	
9:17.1 - 9:18.8	R2CA: In a translation.	
9:19.1 - 9:21.4	R2CA: In translation. Hmm.	
9:22.4 - 9:31.6	R2CA: I think what maybe, maybe I'll rephrase it a couple of times. What I'll try. And I think that to be creative in translation is to	
9:32.2 - 9:52.4	R2CA: grasp the meaning of the original, grasp the style and the tone and and create something new in your own language, taking upon that. I mean not reproducing the phrasing of the original not reproducing the syntax, if not needed not reproducing the metaphors, if not needed, and	
9:53.7 - 9:56.7	R2CA: Yes, more or less. It's good to be phrased these ways of like	
9:57.3 - 10:04.1	R2CA: Finding your own language, different ways to express what was expressed in the original language because if you express it.	
10:04.4 - 10:11.9	R2CA: With the same syntax for words. Then in the original one, it won't have the same effect on your on your language because maybe	
10:12.3 - 10:22.8	R2CA: Is stylistically wrong or it sounds like a translation or it doesn't have these stylistic novelty that the original has that sometimes in translation. I think that we tend to	
10:24.8 - 10:35.0	R2CA: "Plantar" or iron out the other the text that maybe you find in the original one, a very novel or similar style and you	
10:35.7 - 10:51.8	R2CA: enclose it on a very smooth the style with no alterations on the normal order and they have to be creative, as well, because you have to create like a stranger style on your own language as well, we're not we're producing the original one.	
10:53.2 - 10:54.8	R2CA: I don't know if I answered the question.	
10:54.8 - 10:55.3	Yes.	
10:56.8 - 11:09.6	Interviewer: You did, and obviously every mean there isn't a right answer is what when you think. And you also mentioned and	
11:11.4 - 11:25.8	Interviewer: The differences in the text. Okay. You say that you you thought A was okayish B you mentioned sounded like a machine.	
11:26.9 - 11:33.1	Interviewer: And C, and it was maybe more polished. Could you tell me	
11:34.2 - 11:36.1	Interviewer: Which one did you prefer.	
11:38.0 - 11:38.3	R2CA: The third one C	
11:39.2 - 11:40.6	Interviewer: It. Can you tell me why.	
11:41.6 - 11:44.1	R2CA: Yes, I think that from will	
11:46.4 - 11:52.0	R2CA: Read. I think that is a text where I could see a more literary text with no	
11:54.0 - 12:01.1	R2CA: Recurring reproductions of the English syntax, where I could see like a beautiful text in beautiful, maybe it's not the word but	
12:02.2 - 12:24.2	R2CA: A literary texts in in Catalan know where I was not seeing all the time. English behind where I saw the creativity on the word games on the names for the termination center as well with the names of the characters. And so I think that's is it is the text	
12:25.7 - 12:34.7	R2CA: I wouldn't, I don't know if more close to the original one, but that attained the objective or being a literary translation. The, the A	
12:35.0 - 12:52.6	R2CA: The first text as well. But maybe at some point it was not as polished as the other one. In my, in my personal opinion, it's not bad translation. I wouldn't say, Oh, this is terrible. I didn't like translation, but in some points, I think. And it was a bit close to, to the English text.	
12:53.2 - 12:56.2	R2CA: Or maybe... and as well. It was a bit problematic, the way	
12:57.1 - 13:14.6	R2CA: That the A text resolved the word game with the title because I think it was not really solved. So, and taking into account that is the title of the texts. If you don't solve that problem. I think the rest crumbles, a little bit before about	
13:15.2 - 13:17.4	Interviewer: The titles, very similar.	
13:18.8 - 13:28.5	R2CA: And yes, from A to C. They were very similar, but I really didn't like the the option of a	
13:29.2 - 13:30.5	R2CA: For for the title.	
13:32.1 - 13:37.1	R2CA: It was a good I think it wasn't a good direction, maybe with more time or we know sometimes	
13:37.6 - 13:49.1	R2CA: You start translating a novel and you have a word play. And so I'll just say this way and month after when you ever been in a proofreading you find a better option. So maybe	
13:49.6 - 14:03.5	R2CA: That would be in A text like the first option or the first options that he or she had had in mind, or maybe in if you had one month or two months to review it, he would have changed. I don't know.	
14:04.2 - 14:10.1	Interviewer: Okay. And you also mentioned a text B	
14:11.4 - 14:13.6	Interviewer: You thought it was machine translation.	
14:13.6 - 14:16.6	Interviewer: Hmm. So in your opinion.	
14:18.2 - 14:21.3	Interviewer: How was the, the quality of	
14:23.8 - 14:26.3	Interviewer: Of this machine translation.	
14:26.8 - 14:34.6	R2CA: I think, in this particular case, the quality was very, very poor, taking into account that the text had a lot of	
14:36.8 - 14:44.5	R2CA: Humor or word play. A lot of need for creativity and the machine. In this case if it was a machine didn't fulfill	
14:45.0 - 14:51.5	R2CA: And or didn't solve those those problems. There were also a lot of ambiguities, which is on the original text that	
14:52.2 - 15:05.9	R2CA: Obviously, we're not we're not solved the song was also a little bit problematic and the names of the characters, then the address, between "vosté" and "tú"that was also problematic as well.	
15:06.9 - 15:15.0	R2CA: And I'm very close to the to the English phrasing and to the English syntax. So it was not a beautiful text to read it was not enjoyable.	
15:16.3 - 15:17.0	Interviewer: Okay.	
15:18.1 - 15:19.1	Interviewer: And	
15:21.2 - 15:21.8	So,	
15:23.0 - 15:32.2	Interviewer: Did you notice. So you mentioned a little bit. The difference between text. A and C.	
15:34.2 - 15:35.4	Interviewer: And	
15:36.4 - 15:43.3	Interviewer: You mentioned text C was more literary than A, correct?	
15:43.5 - 15:45.7	R2CA: I think so. I think so.	
15:46.6 - 15:50.9	R2CA: Right. So, depends on the on the part of our other paragraphs, but overall I think	
15:52.1 - 15:58.6	R2CA: The translator managed to go a little bit beyond to go a step further with the with the text.	
15:59.2 - 16:08.3	Interviewer: So one of these texts. It was post-edited and the other one was created from scratch.	
16:09.5 - 16:16.8	Interviewer: Which one would you say was post-edited and which one would you say was human or a scratch you know	
16:18.2 - 16:21.7	R2CA: I think the post-edited text was the third one.	
16:23.2 - 16:23.8	R2CA: The C one.	
16:23.8 - 16:25.1	Interviewer: The C	
16:26.0 - 16:27.0	R2CA: I think	
16:27.7 - 16:29.8	Interviewer: Okay. Because, because there are some	
16:30.2 - 16:38.1	R2CA: Because there is an omission, which is also in B  a little, a little omission that's maybe that is not present in A	
16:39.1 - 16:49.4	R2CA: And I thought, maybe the translator of C reproduce this omission because she didn't notice from from the original but because the machine gave the	
16:50.0 - 17:01.6	R2CA: gave this result and post editing he didn't notice that that a little sentence. No, it's not a sentence, a little expression was missing and A in A it was present this expression, I don´t remember now	
17:01.7 - 17:07.3	Interviewer: When you say A was the one that you liked or C	
17:07.6 - 17:21.2	R2CA: Mmmm C is the one that I liked, and I think it was post-edited and A in maybe it was post-edited as well. Maybe both were post-edited I, you know, but in this case I think that's	
17:22.4 - 17:30.6	R2CA: I think that even if C which is the one that I like the most and that I think it was post-edited because of these little omission.	
17:30.8 - 17:34.3	Interviewer: Do you recall the omission? I am going to check	
17:35.7 - 17:37.1	R2CA: I can, I can check it.	
17:43.0 - 17:43.5	R2CA: And	
18:22.8 - 18:24.1	R2CA: One second.	
18:54.2 - 18:55.3	R2CA: Right now.	
19:06.4 - 19:10.3	Interviewer: So you mentioned that the omission was in text A, eh, C.	
19:10.5 - 19:13.0	R2CA: Text C I think	
19:14.7 - 19:17.0	Interviewer: Yeah, I have the impression it was in text A	
19:18.0 - 19:20.6	R2CA: Well, maybe it was in text A and now I'm mixing it. I don't know.	
19:22.0 - 19:23.8	R2CA: I know I don't, I don't remember, but	
19:26.0 - 19:34.0	R2CA: I can check it afterwards if you like, because now I'm not finding it. It was it was a little sentence one like well done, or well	
19:34.9 - 19:37.3	R2CA: Yeah, very, very tiny one	
19:38.5 - 19:42.6	Interviewer: Yeah, I think it could be	
20:03.5 - 20:05.3	R2CA: All rights, maybe	
20:27.3 - 20:30.1	Interviewer: And anyway, the	
20:33.5 - 20:39.5	Interviewer: The human translation was C and the post edited was...	
20:41.9 - 20:42.8	Interviewer: Was a	
20:42.9 - 20:51.4	R2CA: A okay it was maybe I just say that because I thought in my mind that the omission was in C, but maybe the omission was in A. So, and	
20:52.5 - 20:54.7	Interviewer: Maybe I'm thinking, what is when	
20:54.9 - 20:55.2	Interviewer: When you find it	
20:56.0 - 21:02.5	Interviewer: Let me know. Hey, because I think I found an omission. And I think it was in A	
21:03.2 - 21:05.0	Interviewer: And now I can't find it.	
21:05.2 - 21:07.6	R2CA: And maybe it was just, it makes it on my mind but	
21:07.9 - 21:12.1	R2CA: The text sounded more post-edited was definitely A	
21:13.5 - 21:14.0	R2CA: It was	
21:14.8 - 21:17.4	R2CA: A closer to English, it was less creative	
21:20.0 - 21:22.3	R2CA: It had I don't remember. Now, if there was some	
21:23.5 - 21:36.9	R2CA: Meaning problems. I think they did a little bit, maybe more stylistic or were word play and so on, but the one that sounded more post-edited was A but that made me think maybe this. That's a trap. I don't know.	
21:39.4 - 21:43.7	Interviewer: If you find it let me know and	
21:47.1 - 21:49.2	Interviewer: You, you, you mentioned that	
21:51.5 - 22:01.3	Interviewer: These posts edited text a was less creative. So in your experience, not only in this experiment, but in your own experience.	
22:02.8 - 22:11.4	Interviewer: When you have ever used MT. What do you think is the impact of machine translation on your creativity.	
22:12.4 - 22:21.1	R2CA: I think it's huge, because it gives you already have formulation or a phrasing and I think it's sometimes hard to step out this	
22:21.6 - 22:33.4	R2CA: This frame that's because maybe it is correct. It's all right. So you can say, well, that the phrase is well constructed and it's close to English but well it's more or less. Okay, and you don't	
22:34.4 - 22:45.2	R2CA: You don't put into motion. The, the useful mechanisms that that you do you know when I'm translating it automatically. I always am tried to find the	
22:46.3 - 22:53.6	R2CA: The option that is further from from English and then maybe I go back to it to an option that is closer to English, but my first	
22:55.0 - 23:07.8	R2CA: My first move, or what. My gut says is always to find some, something that is not from the phrase, as in the original in the original language. And I think that when you use machine translation, you	
23:09.0 - 23:17.9	R2CA: It is like the horses that you can only see one interpretation of the of the text or one formulation, or one phrasing of the man is more difficult.	
23:18.5 - 23:25.1	R2CA: Because it cuts a little bit this instinct that you have to, or that I when I translate that I normally have to	
23:25.5 - 23:43.1	R2CA: Try to find different formulations and that made it fits better in the in the register in the style of the of the texts in the musicality in the rhythm that's I think that is the most important problem. That's a machine translation poses for the creative translations.	
23:44.7 - 24:01.8	Interviewer: Um, is there any if you had a magic wand or if you could, how do you think machine translation or technology could help literary translators.	
24:07.1 - 24:16.1	R2CA:I don't know. I don't know because I think it's, it should improve so so so much to really be helped. I, I use	
24:18.0 - 24:31.6	R2CA: Assisted translation for terminology issues for... while... as I explained in the expert meeting to avoid and jumping a paragraph or jumping a line.	
24:32.3 - 24:43.6	R2CA: To make sure that the numbers, the proper names are as in the original so in these terms i think that's that's helpful because it doesn't 	
24:44.8 - 25:01.5	R2CA: Coerce my my creativity but it helps me in terms of productivity, because it gives me already, no? some some aspects that I don't have to over think about that or that I don't have to be looking in my glossaries or it's already. It's already there. I know in machine translation...	
25:01.7 - 25:04.6	Interviewer: Sorry, are you referring to CAT tools.	
25:04.7 - 25:11.4	Interviewer: So when you translate which CAT tools do you use?	
25:11.5 - 25:11.8	R2CA: When you translate	
25:12.9 - 25:26.7	R2CA: Wordfast Classic in Word. So I have my my Word document with Wordfast classic and I segments each paragraph to avoid chucking sentences in the little in a little units so	
25:27.9 - 25:29.7	R2CA: Actually, I'm not using it as a	
25:30.9 - 25:37.1	R2CA: Translation Memory, but as a son environment that fosters my my productivity, I would say.	
25:37.8 - 25:55.5	R2CA: It's not that time all the paragraph will never be the same. Inside the inside the novel, but it helped me with terminology, with coherence and to avoid forgetting a line or paragraph, I don't know, maybe in machine translation could be useful in some	
25:56.5 - 26:16.5	R2CA: In some other branches of the editorial world that are not that doesn't demand that this creativity that literature does maybe for divulgative text for essays sometimes and or maybe in inside novel if we have, I don't know, long	
26:18.3 - 26:21.4	R2CA: Chapter that is more technical or more	
26:22.8 - 26:27.5	R2CA: With less orality and it's only describing, I don't know, a forest. I don't know.	
26:28.0 - 26:29.8	R2CA: Maybe there. It could be, it could be	
26:29.8 - 26:32.0	R2CA: More, more useful.	
26:33.7 - 26:44.9	Interviewer: When you work with your tool, do you have activated that the tool shows you a list of MT proposals or not.	
26:44.9 - 26:45.3	No.	
26:46.6 - 26:47.0	No.	
26:48.2 - 26:48.8	Interviewer: Okay.	
26:50.4 - 26:55.6	Interviewer: And having looked at this three texts that you reviewed.	
26:57.3 - 27:05.3	Interviewer: What do you think the reading experience would be for for a reader.	
27:05.5 - 27:09.6	Interviewer: With these different texts. Do you think that we, and	
27:10.6 - 27:12.0	Interviewer: They will be different.	
27:13.4 - 27:14.9	R2CA: I think it depends on the reader.	
27:16.2 - 27:25.8	R2CA: With maybe we could separate this in average readers over. I don't know. My mother takes an oval and it's all right, everything. It's all right for for her and maybe she is not noticing.	
27:26.3 - 27:39.4	R2CA: Translation issues as as we do when we are reading a translated novel. We're all that sounds a bit like English or that sounds a little bit weird. So for an average reader. Well, I think that's B obviously will not be a pleasant.	
27:40.8 - 27:59.3	R2CA: Experience in this case, maybe for, you know, the text machine translation could have worked better and with A. Mm hmm. I don't know, more or less. And I think the reader could have jumped at a little bit at some at some point with the with the word plays and	
28:00.4 - 28:09.6	R2CA: I think it will be like an okay experience like it's not terrible. Like I can continue reading. I'm not going to drop the drop the text, but	
28:10.7 - 28:26.5	R2CA: isn't like a great, great, great literary experience. And that's with an average reader. And with the C text,  I think the experience would be would be nice would be the everything there is. It's a nice constructed text, it is beautiful	
28:27.0 - 28:38.9	R2CA: Word plays is also present. So I think in this case the the experience would be would be nice. For a trained reader with a linguistic background. I think that the first one.	
28:39.8 - 28:47.3	R2CA: Wouldn't be a very good A text wouldn't be a very pleasant experience. Sometimes it reminded me to my students translations.	
28:48.0 - 28:57.3	R2CA: That they have some positive points are there. That's a nice, that's a nice option they did well here and then it crumbles, a little bit afterwards and it's	
28:57.6 - 29:12.3	R2CA: It's like you're mixed feelings with with the stakes and when you finish the reading this translation, overall, you say, Well, it's not it's not B is it's not terrible, terrible, but it also it has room for improvement.	
29:16.5 - 29:24.2	Interviewer: And he within the texts. Did you notice a difference within the texts.	
29:26.0 - 29:29.1	Interviewer: So not between A and 	
29:29.1 - 29:35.6	Interviewer: AND C OR B, but within the text. Did you notice a difference in style?	
29:36.9 - 29:48.4	R2CA: I sometimes I was, I was thinking maybe some parts are totally human translated and some parts are post-edited. I was thinking, sometimes, but I don't know if	
29:48.7 - 29:49.9	Interviewer: In which text.	
29:50.1 - 29:51.3	R2CA: In A and C	
29:53.1 - 29:56.5	R2CA: I was thinking, sometimes because I don't know if it was	
29:58.1 - 30:08.2	R2CA: For instance, in C some some aspects or some, some parts will like these errors. This stylistic errors are because the translator here.	
30:09.2 - 30:25.5	R2CA: hasn't managed to find a better formulation, or because he was post-editing but they they were all errors that could be human errors or from from a post-edition and in A as well because they were also some nice	
30:26.8 - 30:36.9	R2CA: Solutions in some parts and I'm there. I thought maybe this part is fully human, translated and the rest is post-edited. But I don't know I don't know for sure.	
30:37.3 - 30:39.7	Interviewer: Maybe you recall which parts.	
30:40.6 - 30:51.7	R2CA: Maybe what where I marked less errors, where I marked less errors, I think it was maybe more more human or or the post-edition was better. In any case,	
30:52.0 - 31:03.1	Interviewer: Yeah, I saw that you might moderator soon so them text. A and C were translated by two different translators.	
31:04.0 - 31:23.4	Interviewer: Um, so C was all from scratch, but two different translators and the same with A, so A was all post-edited by by two different translators and and C was all human translated by by different translators.	
31:23.4 - 31:26.7	Interviewer: Mm hmm. So I was wondering if you have noticed	
31:28.6 - 31:32.9	Interviewer: That they were different translators, or you just thought that they were using a different tool.	
31:33.8 - 31:40.6	R2CA: I thought I didn't, I didn't think that they were different translators, but I thought that they were using a different tool.	
31:41.0 - 31:59.8	R2CA: I also notice now that I remember that there were variant differences at some points and in I wasn't, I think it was in A at some point they were using the Valencian terminations and in other point where they were using some terminations in e. 	
32:00.0 - 32:03.6	R2CA: They weren't from Valencia...	
32:03.8 - 32:04.4	No!	
32:06.0 - 32:07.4	R2CA: Maybe that was just a typo.	
32:08.7 - 32:09.6	R2CA: Just a typo.	
32:09.7 - 32:10.7	R2CA: Then, forget it.	
32:12.1 - 32:16.1	Interviewer: And yeah, but that's curious as well.	
32:19.3 - 32:30.4	Interviewer: So we were trying to avoid there that people would prefer one texts or the other, just because it's one translator or the other.	
32:30.5 - 32:34.0	Interviewer: That you prefer the style from one translator rather than the other.	
32:34.9 - 32:37.5	Interviewer: So that's why I mix the	
32:38.7 - 32:40.0	Interviewer: The two translators.	
32:40.0 - 32:44.6	Interviewer: Soon, so you have something completely human and something completely post edited.	
32:46.3 - 32:52.5	Interviewer: And but of course there are differences in translators, hmm, in your case,	
32:54.1 - 32:57.7	Interviewer: You marked more errors in one of the translators than in the other.	
32:59.4 - 33:11.2	Interviewer: And and also in your case, the creative shifts you mark more in the in text C than in text A	
33:13.4 - 33:20.3	Interviewer: And but another reviewer the creative shifts were almost equal in the two	
33:22.5 - 33:24.6	Interviewer: So that's, that's interesting as well.	
33:26.2 - 33:32.0	Interviewer: Obviously the machine translated text was the one with the least creative shifts and	
33:33.7 - 33:35.2	Interviewer: But that's kind of logical	
33:37.3 - 33:49.5	Interviewer: And is there anything else that you would like to comment on their review or on machine translation or literary translation.	
33:51.3 - 33:59.7	R2CA: I don't know. I think you asked me so many questions. But if you want to ask me something else. I'll be very happy to to answer, but I don't know what to say. Now,	
34:01.4 - 34:13.0	Interviewer: Maybe the last thing I would ask you is, what did you think of classifying the creative shifts, because this is something new, right? Errors we are all used to	
34:15.1 - 34:21.2	Interviewer: Finding errors and correcting errors and classifying the error, one way or the other, but more or less is	
34:21.2 - 34:25.0	Interviewer: Similar, but we have created this new	
34:26.9 - 34:27.9	Interviewer: Way.	
34:28.0 - 34:29.7	Interviewer: Of looking at creativity.	
34:30.7 - 34:32.5	Interviewer: How did you find that part.	
34:34.4 - 34:53.1	R2CA: I think it was a little bit difficult to know when something is creative, or is just the usual formulation in Spanish, which is different from from English. So I tried to give the like positive point of creative shift when there were	
34:55.1 - 34:57.5	R2CA: Also formulations in Spanish, that could	
34:58.1 - 34:58.8	Interviewer: In Catalan	
34:59.2 - 35:05.7	R2CA: In sorry in Catalan that could be labeled as reproduction, but it would be okay in Spanish to translate it this way.	
35:06.2 - 35:19.5	R2CA: Another translation translator did the effort to find another formulation which is as well correct but that is different from from English, there is where I marked be the creative creative shift.	
35:21.7 - 35:22.9	Interviewer: Did you find it.	
35:28.1 - 35:36.2	Interviewer: How would I ask this, did you find this classification a bit artificial or did you think yeah it's a way	
35:37.5 - 35:41.2	Interviewer: It's a way of classifying. It's a way of understanding	
35:41.8 - 35:49.0	R2CA: I find it very nicely the classification, I think it was easier for me to do the second part of the of the task that the error one	
35:50.6 - 35:54.8	Interviewer: Oh, the errors, but errors are a nightmare, aren't they? What didn't you like about the errors?	
35:57.4 - 35:58.3	R2CA: What didn't I like?	
35:59.7 - 36:00.7	R2CA: It was long. It was very long...	
36:01.3 - 36:01.7	Oh, okay.	
36:03.9 - 36:06.8	Interviewer: It wasn't because the classification was wrong.	
36:06.9 - 36:23.3	R2CA: No, no, no, not for different not not for the classification. It was like I don't know when which category I am in the creative shifts thought it was more straightforward for me. I, I was able to recognize the category more straight forward than in the error one. 	
36:24.7 - 36:39.2	R2CA: As well. Because in the error one, you're like, I don't know if this is a real mistake or is just me or if it's just something stylistic and what with, the reproductions and creative shifts the position was different. It was, well, I'm just judging.	
36:40.2 - 36:47.8	R2CA: Is this creative is this a reproduction, but I'm not marking it as a mistake. So in this sense it was easier for me. The second part.	
36:48.8 - 36:51.8	Interviewer: So when you have to mark errors.	
36:53.4 - 37:02.6	Interviewer: As a human. Do you feel more responsibility towards the translator as well. Were you thinking about the translator.	
37:02.8 - 37:07.8	R2CA: Yes, yes, because I always think maybe this is me that I'm I don't know enough	
37:10.3 - 37:20.9	R2CA: But in the other in the other part of the task with the classification since I had to mark everything since every sentence that you will or potential of	
37:21.8 - 37:41.6	R2CA: Unit of potential creativity had to be in one category. I had no choice but to to choose one. So you made there the choice for me. Maybe it would have been difficult for me to choose the units of potential creativity that would have been a little bit difficult. I think	
37:42.1 - 37:52.3	Interviewer: For when you saw the unit, would you agree that those units were units of creative potential	
37:52.6 - 38:02.1	R2CA: Yes, I think most of them, maybe some of them is one. Well, maybe that I wouldn't have marked this as a unit of potential creativity, but most of them, yes, they made sense.	
38:03.1 - 38:03.5	Okay.	
38:05.4 - 38:06.0	Interviewer: So,	
38:07.6 - 38:14.5	Interviewer: Maybe the word error as well has a connotation, you know that you're penalizing	
38:14.9 - 38:16.0	Interviewer: the person right	
38:18.3 - 38:20.5	Interviewer: Anyway, so that's that's	
38:21.8 - 38:26.3	Interviewer: What I wanted to us. So I'm going to stop the recording.	
38:29.0 - 38:30.4	Interviewer: Now it's asking me	
38:32.4 - 38:33.8	Interviewer: To If yes, you don't
