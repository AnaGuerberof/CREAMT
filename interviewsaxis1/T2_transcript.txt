	Interviewer	
	I was wondering if you could give us a general overview of this text?	
	TR2CAT	
	On both parts I guess my own translation of the review of the SAT translation	
	Interviewer	
	You started with post-editing and then you did your own translation in your case.	
	TR2CAT	
	Yes, okay so to begin with I have never used any computer-assisted translation for literary translation. I have many times or any other kind of translation but not for this kind of texts, and it involved probably working for a different mindset. You know that when you're used to using cat systems you do this fragmented focused type of translation for a little while and then once you have a bigger tax the big chunk of text you can look back and get a broader picture of what you're doing and try to change, if you need to change anything to do that, bearing in mind that you already have a big fragment of a text, but in this particular case and for different reasons and also because I was and then I would come back and I was specifically instructed not to review everything from the beginning but rather just keep on going so I didn't feel really comfortable using the tool of this kind of text even though it wasn't that difficult or as difficult as I thought it would be, just because I'm not used to applying this kind of techniques when working on a book or a short story.	
	Interviewer	
	How do you translate usually?	
	TR2CAT	
	What I mean is that if you can see if the original is perfectly visible from the from the start and you have the whole tax and you can go back and forth and you can even use different modes of reading having the paper that decision and then going back to the screen and repeating the story, even if I don't use all those options I feel comfortable when having them when knowing that I can go back to the text, where is this case I kept focusing on the specific sentence level and because I started with the with the self-translated, with the computer translated half of the story I kept trying to understand the algorithm behind it, I found myself thinking about other considerations that were not that had nothing to do with the text, I kept asking myself why did you translate this word this way and that the same word would come again and then it gave me a different translations at first, and all these questions were there all the time, like in the backburner.  At first I thought that it was using a neural translation system and that's why if it was using other base texts as a source and for comparison reasons that's why one word would get translated differently in different sentences but then I said it doesn't matter, you need to provide a final version of this text that a publishing house would accept but that was a distraction for me, just an intellectual distraction. At the same time, I thought that these were things that one had to ask oneself for literary translation because, for instance, going back to this idea that the same word would come up on different occasions. If I was translating this text from the very beginning, irrationally, like an intuition, I like a gut feeling I would know when a word had to be translated differently because of stylistic reasons, right? because in the target language if you repeat the same word over and over again even though in the English original it might get repeated as well you create an effect on the reader and you know when you need a synonym. There is a moment in which you know you  need to apply for certain stylistic variation whereas here the software already gave me a lot of variance and I had to gauge whether that's kind of diversity of synonyms was the right one for the text, that was not something I had done before. I usually don't proofread other people translations of literary texts so it's not the type of question that I have asked myself before.  I mean it required different kinds of muscles from me to work on reviewing the suggestions from the software and that was interesting. I went back and forth from feeling that it was a nuisance that if they wasn't helping me as a tool and then sometimes I thought oh it came up with quite a nice proposal and maybe I wouldn't have thought of this myself so I I'd say I'm on the fence about whether it's useful or not because it's there's nothing horrible about it as long as you know human eyes go over the text several times before it is handed down but at the same time I can see that there are benefits, there are certain things that can be eliminating for your own process, so I thought I was half convinced of the usefulness of this tool for literary translation. That’s what I take out.	
	Interviewer	
	Okay. And you have kind of talked about the main difficulties in using MT or the proposal, but what were the main difficulties in the text in itself? Can you tell me which specifically were the passages where you thought it was difficult?	
	TR2CAT	
	Well, with any text like this one that has its own universe, you need to understand the rules right of how that universe works if there are new names that are created or that I used differently from a standard world that could be described in literature, you need to understand them before you translate them, whereas here I would just give a first version of the text and once I realize that that particular word or phrasing have a specific meaning in the text I would go back and think better like the title of the author of the story.  So first getting acquainted with the universe and that meant the title of the phone code, the names of the positions and professions that people have in this text, I don’t remember exactly, but I can check. There were a couple of things that I had to really think long and hard before committing to a translation because they can mean a lot of things. The orderly it is pretty straightforward but there are several ways to translate it as long as you know what it entails and then there is this woman, I don’t remember her job or specific job one comes towards the end. She is not an officer she's a steward maybe, no, a hostess, so what kind of hostess, okay she holds what, the termination is another one, the termination bureau, those kind of words that can have different meanings or abstract that have a lot of implied meaning, so the first time I came up with the bureau of termination, I thought it meant termination of pregnancy which is the first thing that comes to mind, and that's why I translated it as “interrupció” because it is usually translated as “interrupció voluntària del embarrass”, then I understood it meant people who decided to terminate their own lives to give space to give room for further life, so that’s what they were doing, interrupting their lives, so I thought it worked both ways work both ways and I wondered if an English the first thing that comes to mind when you read this is pregnancy termination and then you realize it can be used for different purposes, so jobs, institutions, this is this is creative wet where most of the creativity lies in the text…	
	Interviewer	
	Yes, what was this creativity? So, this was one of my questions actually...Where would you say that you had to be more creative? And maybe how would you define this creativity as a literary translator?	
	TR2CAT	
	Regardless of this particular experiment.	
	Interviewer	
	Yeah, you told me here that you had to be creative with the jobs and the names, and that….	
	TR2CAT	
	Because, because it's obvious that there's no one to one translation, there is any right answer, right solution to this because you can read a lot into them they spark a lot of ideas in you and you do your best to stop and analyse what kind of things come to mind when you read a certain word or phrase and then try to come up with a solution that also generates those thoughts in the target reader and that is not a straightforward process but I think the first thing you need to do is to spot where those kernels of creativity are hidden in the text.	
	Interviewer	
	And where would you say they were here in this text face, these kernels of creativity?	
	TR2CAT	
	I can't think of anything else other than what I have already said. Let me try to read this. There is a lot of humour as well in the text so even though the topic or the situation might be grim because we're talking about death all the time and who gets to die who gets to be born, I think it was also important to nail the more comic sentences. Sometimes the civil servants or the doctor or the hostess they have this dry sense of humour, they treat their fellow citizens with a certain contempt, like they are know-it-alls and they know what's best for society so those things were also quite sensitive like first to detect and then try to convey in Catalan, so yes all the more scientific, Syfy aspect of the text plus this humour, I think those were the two things where you could allow yourself to be a bit more distance from the text as long as a general effect was recreated.	
	Interviewer	
	You mentioned that sometimes the MT proposal was quite good in your opinion, do you think having to use the MT,  how do you think it affected your creativity? This creativity that you are talking about, like all of these options, to detect the kernel, and to find all of these options, how do you think having already this MT proposal affect your creativity?	
	TR2CAT	
	For me specifically I think it was useful for the segments of are not particularly creative, but when it  required a higher degree of creativity, if I receive a first version, a first translation of the text I feel more limited, I think you're focused mainly on what you're being given and you're trying to decide whether it's appropriate or not but it's harder for you to then forget about this and think about all the other possibilities that you had whereas if it's blank you do that you initiate the process of okay how can I say this how can I phrase it and then you decide you're given a First Choice and then you end up just reviewing rather than translating, you end up saying okay it is good or maybe  you just change and I think there was an instruction somewhere that you gave me that don’t just translate everything from scratch and say this is not good and erase everything, rather than try to say, save the things that are salvageable and that you think they'll be okay and because that was the instruction I didn't do more than I was expected if the sentence work and was reasonably phrased, I okayed it, so I think in a way it prevents you from being fully creative if you have something to base your decision on and if the text I mean there are a lot of novels and stories that don't have an inch of creativity in them meaning they're pretty straightforward, then this kind of process I think that MT could be very helpful but whenever there's a non-standard text and that deviates from the way that the majority of what describe a situation or a character then even though some proposals are decent and were good and I accepted them it didn't help me become creative because it was harder.	
	Interviewer	
	And so, when you are working on your own and you find a kernel or unit that is potentially creative what is the process that you think you follow to entangle that and translate what is your thought process? How do you go about it? You find this thing and then you go, for example, the title….	
	TR2CAT	
	In this case it was easy because the machine translation didn't give me anything to work on it just copied it and then I understood what it meant how it can be read out loud and I understand that it didn't work so it had to be changed, so it allowed me, it gave me permission to  consider any possibility. So it wasn't very problematic because it did not risk a translation, whereas if I weren't using this, I would go about the regular way I mean you don't have to translate to be or not to be, you see what that you can find a code or numbers or anything you like that that resembles that and then you change it throughout the text, I mean there is no..	
	Interviewer	
	Do you check for the information on the internet? How do you spark the solution? Do you just think about it for a while I leave it to rest then go back to it do you look for accessing the internet how do you go about, do you see how something else has translated this, how do you go about it? Check other languages, not in this particular text but in other texts….	
	TR2CAT	
	For  about 10 years I've only be getting been given contemporary books to translate so I did at the time and usually there were books that had just come out so I didn't have any other translation of the text to compare with or any version in the same language however in the past 5 years I would say there's this trend in Catalan literature of publishing new translation of a previously translated text usually Classics on several of them if you have for the possibility of comparing you translation with others in the same language or other languages, I usually do it in the end precisely because I don´t want to be influenced by whatever somebody else decided before me, so I translated a couple Joseph Conrad’s’ novels Heart of darkness and Typhoon, I am working on a Jane Austen novel now I have a book by Virginia Woolf to translate next year, so in all these cases, I will end up checking other versions of the text but I usually do a first draft without comparing to any other book that are out there. But I do use the internet, and you ask about both things, obviously, I use the internet all the time, I believe we are fortunate to have so many Tools around us that help us solve things that were more puzzles for translators fifty years ago and it depends on the text, sometimes I prefer to work fast and come up with the first draft that I know is far from perfect I just focus all my attention on the editing afterwards when I review the whole thing before delivering it, whereas in some cases that are more creative or that have a lot of possible pitfalls I prefer to work intensely on the sentence by sentence level so that the first draft is already quite good and I don't have to rethink a lot of things how many times if they will pop up during the book I don't know if it's just a strike of genius that the writer had in one little fragment or if they will use that sentence or  image throughout the text then I'll have to try, and it will be something that is pending that I haven't yet solve and it keeps coming at me throughout the translation. If the book is very long I'll try to plummet through it and get a first draft as soon as possible and then focus on the review, if it is short and creative and poetic then I'm slower but I make sure that the first draft is quite final.	
	Interviewer	
	What do you think are the perils? Like you were saying that if you have an MT proposal, in a way, you said I don't have to use my creativity in the same way, unless it's completely wrong and then I know it's wrong and I have to start from scratch…	
	TR2CAT	
	I wouldn't say I don't have to use my creativity, I would say that it is harder for me to use it. I've been given one possible answer and then I think it's physically more difficult for me to access information in my brain when I already have something that I need to distance myself from so it's not that I don't have use it, it is just that I can´t or I find it harder.	
	Interviewer	
	So, what are the perils do you think if the translation is done with this proposal for the end product for the literary piece, what are the perils of this final result? How do you think the final translation is in comparison to a final translation that you have done without this proposal?	
	TR2CAT	
	Funnily enough, and I know that this is not the answer but I also started my PhD many years ago and then I left it but I was working I had over their body of work to work on my thesis and my idea was to analyse weather there was such a thing as an interpretese language meaning there were certain people that had already started to analyse if there was a specific translational language that was used that marked a translation as compared to an original, and I was trying to do the same thing with interpretation, because I am mostly an interpreter, and one of the things that I studied all the time and that I kept thinking and that is particularly applicable to this situation when you have words or concepts that are that have 121 translations this process is quite safe because if it can make mistakes but you spot them, the problem is when one reality in one language are several possibilities, Just an example a box a box in Spanish is “caja”, and that`s it, there are several type of boxes but mainly as a general concept, box is caja, whereas in Catalan you have “capsa” and “caixa”, you have two of them depending on the material they are made of, whether they are big or small, so it is so easy that any machine translation will translate “capsa” and “caixa” as box and it will be the right translation, but if we are working the other way around it will have to choose and it won't have enough context to choose from so basically we'll go to the unmarked translation which is “caixa” because it's more general and it applies to more situations so what's the danger there, you were asking, well, that “capsa” gets forgotten, because most readers that read “caixa” will think it is fine, most boxes are caixes, only some specific boxes are not, and even if a “capsa” is being described as “caixa”  it takes a reader or speaker that is very aware of the language super sensitive to detect it and say well this is not a caixa, it is a capsa, most readers will read through and understand it and not even question it, so the dangers are that you can get a more standard  language where this kind of nuances that don't necessarily have a literary nature, it is not about poetic language,  this is day to day language we are talking about, this kind of nuances or different ways of segmenting the world get lost, it is the typical Eskimo example of how many words for white they have, if you get a MT from English where the word white is used probably it will go to one standard in with word for a white that will work for most situations and the rest will get forgotten, and probably readers if they keep reading texts where that’s the only way to translate white might even forget and stop using the other synonyms for white that are only partial to whiteness, so that’s one danger that I can think of.	
	Interviewer	
	What if the MT proposal gave you capsa and caixa?	
	TR2CAT	
	Both to choose from.	
	Interviewer	
	So, you know this variety of options that you mentioned rather than only one. Would you like that?	
	TR2CAT	
	Yes, of course, that would be very useful. It would save me the trouble of going to a dictionary of synonyms which we do all the time and it will help me choose from two multiple-choice kind of questions right, again it can be reductive depending on how it is done, but if it works out, it can be useful.	
	Interviewer	
	Is there a limit to this? In the sense what I'm trying to say is that sometimes if you're given ten options, is it more confusing than helpful?	
	TR2CAT	
	Not to me, I would say not to a literary translator because that's what we do anyway all the time if not like we start searching for possibilities and once we get to three we stop because we do not want to get confused. If we're not completely convinced we keep looking, if you like the second choice you find that's it you say all that was what I was looking for but if you're not 100% convinced and you are detail oriented you keep looking for other choices and then you get ten, fifteen and then you might get dazzled and you might not know what to choose, but it is your day to day, how we work, you will end up choosing one because you know you have to. At least for me, it wouldn't be confusing. There could be different steps or different levels of specificity so I could get, let’s say, but I could get three, four proposals at first, which are the more general, and then if I don't like them they could be like a step to say, no, I rule them out they are the more standard ones and they do not suit this context, and then I could be given four other choices depending on more specific words and this could go on depending on how many possibilities you have, but you could do that. When I was also working on my PhD I was also working on this idea of creating an inverted dictionary meaning instead of looking for a word and the final definition, start with the definition what do you call when you walk aimlessly and you're tired like there are thirty different word for walking I know.	
	Interviewer	
	Those exist.	
	TR2CAT	
	Yes, I know, I am talking about fifteen or twenty years ago,  there were people talking about that and I thought it was a great idea because this is similar to what we do when we have a word at the tip of our tongue. We think I know there's a word I know it means this and that, and it can be understood this way or the other but I just can't think of it so you look for synonym to look for similar context, parallel texts over the internet but it's the same process it's like narrowing down the focus of possible translations until you find the right one okay.	
	Interviewer	
	So, I'm going back to how the MT proposal... what's it you know you mentioned that sometimes it was helpful sometimes it made it more difficult. Can you elaborate on that?	
	TR2CAT	
	I don't really recall other specific examples in which I thought hum, that was good, but I know there were some. The text is not old but it has this vintage tone in some of the words that they use right away they call one another and they say everything's swell and they call each other old duck or old fart, I don´t know, but  something a bit quaint, it is not city language, it is either from a small town or from the 50s and 60s I mean you can tell that the way they talk to one another is a bit oldish, and I thought that’s something that a computer might not pick up but it did I remember I don't remember the word but I remember that what it gave me was adjusted to the time period. And I thought that was clever, I would expect a more I don't remember if it translated old duck literally probably to say a duck that was old but other things that were not phrases that were just single words, it did a good job. The one thing that really got on my nerves is what I told you orderly comes up five or six times and every time it came up it translated it differently, I couldn't understand why did that unless you know it was a new neural system and it had different texts where it extracted this word in different contexts, it said “infermer”, it said…	
	Interviewer	
	“Celador”	
	TR2CAT	
	I said “celador” because it was the only one that did not appear there and I thought it was the best one for this particular thing, I would say that a more modern world like “auxiliar” or “assistent sanitari” but there were like four different kinds of translations for the same word one fragment after the other, back to back, like not in a different context and that was something that I couldn't understand, why it did it, and it was confusing.	
	Interviewer	
	Would you say that you are satisfied with the translation that you provided?	
	TR2CAT	
	Before I answer that just one thing that came to mind, I was thinking that if I was using a regular machine translation software, one of the branded ones, probably the system would learn from my correcting it so the first time I said probably not always, you have to exported to the memory, we know how it works, it is not easy, but ideally if the book I am working has 300 pages and I am using this software, I want it to learn, I don't want to repeat the same kind of correction 300 times, so if there is a character that keeps cropping up all the time, I am willing to help the software understand that I want to call this character “celador” a couple times, maybe three, but that’s it, because if I need to keep changing this through the 300 pages, this is a short story but it could be a novel, then what’s the point. I am doing extra work when it is not needed. So I would expect the software to learn from what I tell it but that's for the first question, and then am I satisfied with the translation, I felt that it was a specific kind of translation experiment with very clear instructions so with that in mind and also because I was quite busy at the time I thought it was decent now for instance, now that I opened the whole PDF and I read that the story I realized that there were things I didn't have in mind because I was focusing on the sentence by sentence when it gives like 10 different names that this institution gets, the nicknames, now that I read it is obvious that they are said in alphabetical order, but when I was thinking of it, it was difficult enough to come up with a Catalan equivalent that I didn't I didn't notice that they were being offered in alphabetical order so now if I have the time and I could change the text again I would change the order of those nicknames so that in Catalan they are also alphabetical, these are things that probably take, that you spot in a second review or in a third reading, you know once you, this is a story collection, so maybe that's the time that I would go devote to this story but then I would go over all the others and once it's done I would read the whole thing and that's where I hope I would spot things like that and change them, so I didn't have that extra reading that I would normally have.	
	Interviewer	
	And how many times do you usually review or there isn't a specific…? It depends on the text...	
	TR2CAT	
	As I told you if the draft is quite final, if I think that I found a solution to all the issues that I had identified, I only read once I print it I usually print the translation and work on it on paper and then I transfer the changes to the file, the last one I did was the first book that I didn't feel like reviewing on paper I started but I thought it was taking me a lot of time because precisely because it was a classic and I had other versions of the text so it took me a lot of time to read compare and then write it out and then change it also on the electronic files so I forgot about the printout. But usually I go through one final review on the paper, after I have worked on the text.	
	Interviewer	
	And this is a bit of a question just for us. I think I asked all the questions I don't know if you want to say anything about the translation or  anything that you feel you want to say.	
	TR2CAT	
	It was interesting, I mean I was curious about this possibility, mostly because Carlota has been vocal about it on social networks, that she uses MT for her books usually and that it can be very helpful, and she is the first translator I hear that is an advocate for MT in our world.	
	Interviewer	
	I didn't know.	
	TR2CAT	
	You didn't know	
	Interviewer	
	Do you use a Google translator, or Linguee or any not to Translate, to have a draft, but to check? Do you ever used it?	
	TR2CAT	
	Google Translator, no, never…	
	Interviewer	
	DeepL?	
	TR2CAT	
	Linguee, Reverse or this kind of things that don't translate but rather find you buy parallel texts, yes, this I use, not on a sentence by sentence level, usually it is to see a word in context in different contexts, right, not any specific MT,	
	Interviewer	
	And in your opinion, how do you see this? How do you see the possibility or the use of MT or some form of MT in literature or not necessarily in literature but in more creative translation? How do you see this now that you have done this little test or experiment?	
	TR2CAT	
	Well, obviously, I'm sad, you cannot not be sad if this is what you do, and you realize that first there's an attempt or a will to start using these Tools in one of the few Industries where no one expected to use them because…	
	Interviewer	
	Is there a will? Do you think there is a will to use it?	
	TR2CAT	
	I didn't think there was but in a very short period of time I find out that a colleague says it's quite useful for her, she even gave a seminar on it recently and then I get this opportunity to be part of an academic research project that deals with this. I don´t know what the point is behind these, but it is out there and before it wasn´t. I am not saying that things will change automatically, but  with the Catalan and Spanish being so similar… So, with Catalan and Spanish we can see that  there are attempts to translate with MT and just get the minimal human action on the text. For instance, newspapers...  not books, but it will come a time, there are a lot of bilingual newspapers that just work like that, they have one version come and during the night a team of reviewers go over the translated text so  I think it's a matter of time before we see this in books that are not specifically creative, nonfiction, the type of nonfiction that is highly informational, you know, mushrooms in Catalonia or, I don´t know, sports, not yet with strong authorial presents like an author that has a particular style, not yet, but who knows, we didn't think this was even possible but MT systems are getting better and better.	
	Interviewer	
	You said you were sad. Why is this?	
	TR2CAT	
	It is one of those self-fulfilling prophecy it might sounds apocalyptic but if machines take over a part of what you do, even though it might be sold as helpful because it might be said that it takes away the strain and laborious tasks off your work right and then you just sign at the end and it has helped you achieve something that will take you three months in just one month for instance, and that can be seen as an advantage. I think it is naive to think that this will allow you to keep working in the same way. I mean literary translation is already ill paid everywhere enough so that in the future they might say no you know 30% off your work will be solved by this translation so we will take off 30% of your rate as well, so can it be helpful? Maybe from a technical point of view but for a human perspective, I don't think so, even if I know that there's nothing we can do because the value of a craftsmanship if you want to call it that way it's not part of our Zeitgeist is not something our society values anymore or not as much so that might be a niche for people that are willing to find that are authentic and genuine and nothing to do with machines and they will pay for it, but it will no longer be a popular vehicle for culture it will not be something that everyone aspires to have or to enjoy, and at least for me, there is always this reluctance, from  anyone to accept any kind of technical progress. I'm not that way, I am open to a lot of technological Improvement to make my day better my life easier but for me right now it's hard to imagine how this can help me in my... can help me from that point of view from the survival part of you in my work. It has helped me, and it is helping me with legal marketing economic texts that I do, obviously if I have a client I've been working for many years and I have to keep piling up translations and I have this great memory that I can use, sure, it is helpful.  I am not a Luddite I mean I use it and I am all for it, but literature I'm resisting. I think it will take some convincing. I need to see other possibilities. I need to see how it makes what I do better and how the industry values it and I don't expect anything great from it, for book translation particularly.	
	Interviewer	
	For the reader of a translation do you think they experience the reading experience will be different then? Because you mentioned before I kind of sense of loss of lexical variety. If we go into a world where this happens then what is the impact of that in the readership.	
	TR2CAT	
	If we are talking about a reader who reads one book a year, that is most people, that book that they have to buy for Sant Jordi and stuff like that, no impact whatsoever, it might even be easier for them. If we are talking about a connoisseur or a lover of a literature that values singularity and style and different voices and differences in general then it will be detrimental it will show a world that is flatter and more even more uniform	
	Interviewer	
	So, we should...	
	TR2CAT	
	And if it works the other way, the right way, if  it is quite good, it is even more dangerous because you don't really realize it, you internalize it, it gets into your unconscious it's blatantly bad, then it's not a danger because people realize the problem is if it's good enough.	
	Interviewer	
	So, the technical side of MT should presumably strive to reproduce the variety that humans have, the creative side that humans have in the machines…	
	TR2CAT	
	Is creativity reproducible? Why should we expect machines to carry out something that up to now has been considered exclusively human? The very existence of machines is based on the possibility to reproduce things and to replicate processes. If we are asking from them to do the opposite, it might be in vain not from the point of view that we won't get there but why should we? Why should we get there? What is the point? For us to become less creative I want a machine to help me do the stuff that I don't want to do that I cannot do at the same level, but I can focus on other stuff that only I can do. If we take that away from our intellectual capabilities it will only make us dumber and I don't see the point…	
	Interviewer	
	What if the use of technology might favour the exchange of literature or ideas in different languages that are not English to other languages or Spanish to Catalan?

	That already exists, at least in Catalan literature, we publish hundreds and hundreds of books from other cultures, we just love, we are serial translation. Translators in in this industry, we keep translating everything that's amazingly interesting what a farmer from a remote island of Scotland or a tribal leader from Samoa have said about their days and we keep translating that, we are a very porous culture, we don't come from the Anglo-Saxon world, where to translate or to publish a translated book is seen as something so bold did and they believe they are going to lose all their money because they are translating from German or from  French, we are not talking about far away languages, we are talking about high cultural languages. It is difficult for them to publish any translation in the US in the UK in other English markets.	
	Interviewer	
	But it is true that in the European Union even some language directions are not that much represented, if you look at the books published in Spain or in Catalonia that come from English or that come from other languages, it is kind of striking, the difference…	
	TR2CAT	
	Are you saying that the reason is that there is a lack of translators in those languages?	
	Interviewer	
	No, that you have to pay a lot of money to do it in the publishing world, right?	
	TR2CAT	
	Yes, but if you expect to use machine translation just to help that particular culture become better known. Does it have anything in particular that culture? Does it have anything unique? Because if it doesn’t,  it's going to go through a set of algorithms that will be less developed because most of the money goes to English related machine translation, so for this to work like for Catalan and I don´t know…	
	Interviewer	
	Macedonian?	
	TR2CAT	
	Macedonian to be a reality,  it has to go through English, so it will be even worse because it will do Macedonian, English, English, Catalan,  so you risk losing so much missing out on so much of the richness, what you expect to be unique about that original that the final result will not help you understand Macedonian culture. It will be a flat, dull product. It's like that game where you say one thing and then you keep repeating the message, and then towards the end… there is no relation to what it meant in the beginning, so this is what it will be if we favour this kind of techniques for far away languages. I don't think it will help. It helps to have Google Translator if you come up with… I don´t know if you end up on a Macedonian website and you want to know what that is about, at least to get an idea but to appreciate literary genius, no. Please, no.	
	Interviewer	
	Is there anything else that you want to comment on, Y?	
	TR2CAT	
	What we said that there was something that we hinted at and that to me is helpful. And it has nothing to do with machine translation but rather with computer-assisted translation. So I am all for computer-assisted translation if  this process can be streamlined somehow, if the computer tells me remember that there are more synonyms or ways of doing this or even that there is a quote from the Bible or from Shakespeare, if the computer would help me saying, no, there are...this has been translated three times in your language and here are the options and you want to use them or do you want to create your own, sure, that's helpful because at the end of the day I choose it just spears me the trouble of finding that information, so if it is about locating information that exists, great, if it's about reminded me that I have a lot of possibilities and the computer knows this, great, as long as I have got the final work but machine translation I think it's the least useful of the a possibilities that a computer can offer you.
