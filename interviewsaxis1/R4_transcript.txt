0:02.5 - 0:06.2	Interviewer: So good morning good good good good afternoon.	
0:06.6 - 0:07.4	R4NL: Good afternoon.	
0:09.7 - 0:26.4	Interviewer: And so I wanted to, if you could give me your general view on reviewing these three texts. What was your in general your impression... how was the task? a little bit your general...	
0:27.1 - 0:39.8	R4NL: Well, in general, I thought it was an interesting subject to start with, I was very curious myself see how especially how good the machine translation would be. I was very interested in reading that.	
0:41.5 - 0:48.3	R4NL: I like, especially the first part, where we had to do the like just the Word correction in Word like you would normally correct.	
0:50.2 - 0:59.4	R4NL: So I really liked that part as well, and then the second part, well, we had to fit in like all the Excel sheets, I was challenging I would say.	
1:01.4 - 1:04.2	R4NL: It because it because it was a lot of work and.	
1:05.8 - 1:09.9	R4NL: Sometimes I found it quite difficult like to you had to select categories.	
1:10.8 - 1:25.7	R4NL: For for certain types of errors and things like that sometimes I found it quite difficult to select the right category and things like that, so that took quite a lot of time and especially with the machine translation, where there were a lot of errors.	
1:26.8 - 1:33.8	R4NL: That was very time consuming so oh yeah that was like I think my general.	
1:35.7 - 1:37.1	R4NL: idea here sure yeah.	
1:38.6 - 1:50.5	Interviewer: And what did you think of all, what do you think what were the main difficulties...	
1:52.5 - 2:04.3	Interviewer: Apart from categorizing the errors what were the main difficulties in the text, what passages do you think were more difficult to translate and to review.	
2:05.1 - 2:11.8	R4NL: I think the ones were more creative, which required like the the part where there was the words it's like a poem or.	
2:12.2 - 2:12.8	Interviewer: The song.	
2:12.8 - 2:16.2	R4NL: song the song like requires a lot more creativity.	
2:17.3 - 2:34.0	R4NL: So those those types of, of course, like the word play with the title alone like to be or not to be... those were difficult well I don't know if they were difficult for me to correct I think they were quite difficult, probably for the translators, for the human translator.	
2:35.7 - 2:37.3	R4NL: For me, to correct.	
2:39.7 - 2:46.4	R4NL: Well yeah it was quite obvious like with the machine translation that was just wrong, so it was quite easy to correct.	
2:47.0 - 2:54.9	R4NL: In that sense, but I think that's for for the text itself, I think those were the most challenging passages pretty much...	
2:56.4 - 3:00.0	Interviewer: So you did mention creativity and.	
3:00.1 - 3:03.2	Interviewer: and where the translators had to be creative.	
3:04.2 - 3:11.5	Interviewer: So, apart from this song and the title and are there any other.	
3:12.7 - 3:27.2	Interviewer: categories or or or or things in the text that you found that translators, had be creating and as some addendum to this question what is creativity for you in translation?	
3:28.4 - 3:29.0	Interviewer: Something easy.	
3:29.6 - 3:37.6	R4NL: yeah well I think other other parts where like the the names for the for the Bureau for termination.	
3:39.3 - 3:50.0	R4NL: Those were, I think, creativity in this respect is that, as a translator you have to not translate too literally in the sense, you have to more try and translate...	
3:51.3 - 4:03.8	R4NL: In the spirit of the text and with both like the original texts in mind, but also the target reader from the target culture in mind, so you kind of have to balance between the two, I think, as a translator.	
4:04.7 - 4:12.1	R4NL: And, especially in literary translation I think that's often more difficult than it is in some other types of translation.	
4:12.6 - 4:21.2	R4NL: Because you have to be more creative because there are more I think cultural references and things like that, where you cannot just translate one on one.	
4:21.9 - 4:34.6	R4NL: You have to find an alternative that works, both with regard to the original text, but also in the target culture, so I think that's where creativity comes in for translators.	
4:36.8 - 4:43.7	Interviewer: And how would you define creativity if somebody asked you, maybe outside of translation.	
4:47.6 - 4:49.9	R4NL: How would I define it maybe like.	
4:51.4 - 4:53.0	R4NL: To think outside the box, something like that.	
4:57.7 - 4:59.1	Interviewer: Okay interesting.	
5:01.6 - 5:18.6	Interviewer: So Are you... so there were these three texts, and you have to do this, all these tasks, so were you overall satisfied with a review that you did? that you think all these three texts after me correcting them, they are okay.	
5:19.8 - 5:23.1	R4NL: No, I wouldn't say so, especially with.	
5:24.2 - 5:37.0	R4NL: machine translation text B I think if I were to get that like in a normal real life situation if that would be the text that I would get from like a client to correct, I would say i'm sorry, but this is.	
5:37.9 - 5:47.6	R4NL: This is not going to work, I cannot make a functional text from this, it will be too much work, you can better just start from scratch and do it all over again.	
5:47.9 - 5:55.3	R4NL: So I think, even with my corrections, I think, also because there was so much I think i'm probably missed.	
5:55.4 - 5:56.2	R4NL: Things as well.	
5:56.7 - 5:57.3	Interviewer: Of course.	
5:57.5 - 6:12.1	R4NL: Because there was so much and after some time, like everything turns red light in your Word document, and you, you kind of lose sight of some things and I also I thought about this after I finish, I also think that.	
6:13.1 - 6:24.6	R4NL: Because of the order in which I review, I believe I got first Text A was post-edited I think and then fix B was machine translated and I think text C was human translated, I think.	
6:26.2 - 6:27.9	R4NL: Because of that order.	
6:28.9 - 6:40.9	R4NL: I started, especially when I got to the machine translation, maybe focus more on accuracy, because that was already such a big problem in the machine translation text.	
6:41.5 - 6:51.7	R4NL: That I sometimes felt I lost track of things like more subtle things like style and those kinds of things and I think that also.	
6:53.0 - 7:00.4	R4NL: Affected my last review so of text C because that was kind of in my head still when I did that, because you did.	
7:00.5 - 7:01.5	R4NL: The three in a row.	
7:01.9 - 7:11.8	R4NL: yeah I think that also had an effect on the way I did the review, so if I would work have gotten them like separately, without seeing the other ones.	
7:12.9 - 7:14.7	R4NL: I think that would have also made a difference.	
7:16.1 - 7:28.8	Interviewer: So I asked you, I saw in your questionnaire and and that your preference was text C which you think is the human  the fully human.	
7:29.6 - 7:47.3	Interviewer: And then text A which was, in your view, post-edited and then text C that was a machine translated, so this is indeed the case, it was this... they were produced in this way.	
7:47.7 - 7:54.9	Interviewer: yeah did you notice within each of those texts any difference within the text.	
7:56.6 - 8:06.8	Interviewer: So text A or text C... one was post-edited the other one was human translation, were there any internal differences in your view?	
8:08.3 - 8:17.0	R4NL: You mean how I saw the text separately Oh, I think, if I had to judge them separately, I would say that text C there was a lot more creativity.	
8:17.5 - 8:21.2	R4NL: Text A seemed a bit like yeah.	
8:23.9 - 8:24.5	R4NL: I think that.	
8:24.7 - 8:26.2	Interviewer: Do you think it is the same translator?	
8:28.8 - 8:30.0	R4NL: I don't think so actually.	
8:33.3 - 8:36.6	R4NL: I mean no I don't think so I don't think it's the same translator.	
8:36.9 - 8:40.8	Interviewer: Do you think there were more than one translator in any of these translations.	
8:42.2 - 8:43.0	R4NL: um.	
8:44.6 - 8:48.8	R4NL: It could have been I haven't really thought about that actually.	
8:49.2 - 8:53.6	Interviewer: So you didn't think when you were correcting...oh this is another person.	
8:55.0 - 9:03.2	R4NL: No, no, no, like not in a text itself, I did, I do have to say, like in text C which was the human translation, I did sometimes find like oh this.	
9:04.5 - 9:20.1	R4NL: seems a bit different in style sometimes, but that was throughout the text, so it kind of switch so if there were two people working on it, then they would have switched I think it was not like half was done.	
9:21.3 - 9:28.4	R4NL: by one person than the other half by another person not like that, but maybe sometimes, especially in the dialogues I guess.	
9:29.5 - 9:30.5	Interviewer: So...	
9:30.6 - 9:34.8	Interviewer: They were done by two people in relay exactly like that.	
9:35.0 - 9:38.3	Interviewer: The first part by one, and the second part by another one.	
9:39.6 - 9:42.0	Interviewer: Now these same two people.	
9:43.4 - 9:47.2	Interviewer: worked on the other text that was post-edited.	
9:47.4 - 9:49.1	R4NL: So that was text A.	
9:49.3 - 9:51.7	Interviewer: So I tell you how it went.	
9:52.0 - 9:54.3	Interviewer: yeah translator one.	
9:55.6 - 9:57.4	Interviewer: Translated humanly.	
9:58.5 - 10:04.0	Interviewer: The text for the second time they had a proposal that they had to correct.	
10:04.4 - 10:13.7	Interviewer: Right, but then we're asked to to post-edit to to a publishing quality, so they could make all the changes that they wanted.	
10:15.5 - 10:22.6	Interviewer: translate two started post-editing and then translated humanly.	
10:23.3 - 10:38.6	Interviewer: And then we put together these hybrids so that and then people wouldn't choose one text because translator A is a better translator B.	
10:38.9 - 10:40.3	R4NL: Right yeah.	
10:40.7 - 10:43.1	Interviewer: But I was wondering.	
10:44.4 - 10:53.0	Interviewer: If people have realized, I have to say that so far none of the reviewers in in any of the two languages have realized that there were.	
10:55.3 - 10:59.6	Interviewer: There was any possibility of separate people working on them.	
11:01.7 - 11:08.1	Interviewer: And are you surprised that the same translators working text A and B... and C.	
11:08.1 - 11:19.4	R4NL: yeah I am actually because I would have thought that if the same translator had also done the correction on like the post-editing on text, as they would have made more changes I would have thought.	
11:21.7 - 11:36.6	Interviewer: I haven't done the analysis of the changes because I ran a program for the Catalan they had made a lot of changes but still the reviewers did not choose.	
11:37.6 - 11:42.7	Interviewer: And text A they chose things C.	
11:44.0 - 11:50.6	R4NL: yeah I think if I like think of how I would probably feel if I would be like post-editing.	
11:51.2 - 12:04.1	R4NL: That the translation that you already week I already felt that also because I was doing three times the same texts your influence when you already read, one of the translations it gets stuck in your head and it makes it more difficult to be creative.	
12:05.2 - 12:18.8	R4NL: And to think outside the box, so I think that that may have been part of the reason why text A does not seem as natural or creative as text C even though it was done by the same people.	
12:20.8 - 12:26.5	Interviewer: yeah this is the danger, maybe, but when you got to text C.	
12:27.7 - 12:33.5	Interviewer: And this was a better translation, were you where you relief where yeah pleased.	
12:35.3 - 12:37.8	R4NL: Yes, very much so, I think.	
12:38.0 - 12:46.6	R4NL: yeah I was very, very pleased because, especially because I did text B before that, which was, I thought was just really bad and not usable.	
12:47.8 - 13:07.6	R4NL: So yeah that was very much a relief and I thought about this also after I finished the task like if I would have only seen C without having seen text A and B would I have been as positive about that translation, as I had been now, and I think probably not actually.	
13:08.4 - 13:11.8	R4NL: I think that, reading the other two versions first.	
13:12.6 - 13:17.2	R4NL: made me more positive about text C and I probably would have been more strict.	
13:18.6 - 13:21.9	R4NL: Perhaps in correcting text C if I hadnÂ´t seen.	
13:23.3 - 13:24.4	R4NL: text A and B before that.	
13:24.7 - 13:25.4	and	
13:26.5 - 13:27.6	Interviewer: Do you think.	
13:30.7 - 13:36.3	Interviewer: What was your impression of the quality of the ones that were done by humans?	
13:37.6 - 13:38.5	Interviewer: But overall.	
13:38.8 - 13:44.7	Interviewer: Do you think they can be published, maybe with a bit of editing or What was your impression?	
13:45.6 - 13:50.5	R4NL: I think that they they could be published, but they definitely still needed the editing they couldn't be like.	
13:53.3 - 14:01.2	R4NL: They still they still needed editing and like I said before, I made it have spent as much time on checking on style, as I would have.	
14:01.6 - 14:08.9	R4NL: Normally, if I would have just read text C because I was so focused on the accuracy after reading text A and B.	
14:09.5 - 14:23.6	R4NL: But I think that that was in hindsight, something that maybe could have been improved in text C but that may have also been because of what you said, like it was two translators and that that switching of style.	
14:23.8 - 14:25.0	R4NL: may have been caused.	
14:25.3 - 14:26.0	R4NL: By that.	
14:27.6 - 14:28.6	R4NL: So yeah.	
14:29.2 - 14:33.0	R4NL: I think I think text C with some editing could be published.	
14:33.3 - 14:33.8	Interviewer: Okay.	
14:33.8 - 14:37.8	R4NL: But it did it did need editing and I did notice that there are also some.	
14:39.2 - 14:49.8	R4NL: errors that were like major errors that I was like oh those really should be noticed before you publish like some interpretation errors and things like yeah.	
14:49.9 - 14:59.4	R4NL: yeah that that that I thought well Okay, if this was for an actual publisher the maybe there are too many in them.	
15:01.0 - 15:03.4	R4NL: For like a really experienced translator maybe.	
15:03.5 - 15:04.0	Interviewer: mm hmm.	
15:05.6 - 15:06.9	R4NL: That was my impression.	
15:07.4 - 15:10.1	R4NL: hmm I don't know how many there were in total.	
15:11.6 - 15:14.3	R4NL: In the in like the major major error.	
15:14.4 - 15:14.7	R4NL: Oh.	
15:15.6 - 15:19.8	Interviewer: yeah yeah so, in your opinion.	
15:21.3 - 15:25.1	Interviewer: What... you did mention that you made a lot of changes.	
15:26.9 - 15:29.6	Interviewer: In the machine translation...in text B...	
15:29.9 - 15:39.6	Interviewer: yeah but what was your impression of the quality of this machine translation in comparison to what you tend to imagine machine translation is.	
15:40.1 - 15:41.0	R4NL: um.	
15:42.0 - 16:00.1	R4NL: Well, I thought it was quite what I had expected actually a lot of literal translations and like, no, no, eye for context and things like that, and no eye for style and things like that which was kind of what I had expected from a machine translation so.	
16:00.3 - 16:04.7	Interviewer: Do you use it? Do you sometimes check things? or do you use it at all?	
16:05.0 - 16:14.9	R4NL: I sometimes use it to find synonyms and things like that, but then it's usually just a sentence or even just a word or phrase that I put in.	
16:15.7 - 16:27.8	R4NL: But I only do that, after I tried it myself and i'm like oh my mind is going blank or if it's not right, yet, and then I try and see if it comes up with a synonym that I think would work.	
16:28.8 - 16:41.8	R4NL: When that way I do use it sometimes but I like with literary translation i've never liked done a whole text run it through a machine translation and then edit it that just.	
16:42.5 - 16:45.5	Interviewer: What do you think the impact on your creativity would be?	
16:46.9 - 17:05.0	R4NL: would definitely hamper my creativity, I think, like I said, if you already see another translation before you thought about yourself it influences influences your thinking so it limits, I think your creativity and where your mind goes when you try to translate.	
17:06.1 - 17:09.8	Interviewer: Where do you, what do you think their mind goes when you translate.	
17:15.2 - 17:16.3	R4NL: That's an interesting question. Not sure actually.	
17:16.7 - 17:20.0	R4NL: it's quite hard, maybe to describe.	
17:21.3 - 17:29.0	R4NL: And it also difference differences sometimes because sometimes you're like in a in a flow and then it seems like it'll almost it comes like.	
17:29.5 - 17:37.9	R4NL: In your head, naturally, and at other times, you have to think about the same sentence for a very long time before you find a solution that you're happy with.	
17:41.2 - 17:46.5	R4NL: Oh yeah I think it is just letting your mind wander a bit maybe something like that.	
17:48.3 - 17:53.3	R4NL: So if you already have like another translation then you're limited or influenced.	
17:53.6 - 17:54.1	R4NL: by it.	
17:56.2 - 18:09.6	Interviewer: And if ... some readers are giving these three text takes A, B and C and they are asked about their enjoyment, what do you think the impact on the readers will be.	
18:11.2 - 18:13.3	R4NL: Well, I think that text B they would hate.	
18:14.5 - 18:28.5	R4NL: Especially because something's just didn't make sense at all like they would, I think they were genuinely be confused by some parts I think A would be all right I think they would you know get the gist of it.	
18:29.9 - 18:32.2	R4NL: But I think they would appreciate text C most.	
18:33.4 - 18:38.3	R4NL: Because it would read more naturally, and it would be more entertaining like the.	
18:38.6 - 18:46.9	R4NL: wordplay and things like that works in text C which doesn't work in the other two, so they would get much more out of it, I guess.	
18:48.3 - 18:59.9	Interviewer: And what do you think that potentially using machine translation and what do you think potentially could be the impact on a language or a text?	
19:01.7 - 19:08.1	Interviewer: All these people using machine translation, you know even for gisting for for.	
19:08.7 - 19:14.3	R4NL: I think for some texts it's fine I mean it kind of depends on the type of text I guess.	
19:16.0 - 19:25.9	R4NL: I mean if it's just like a manual or things like that it wouldn't be a problem at all, except, of course, you have to check that it's correct, but those types of texts.	
19:26.9 - 19:29.5	R4NL: are not really influenced by style and things like that.	
19:31.2 - 19:42.1	R4NL: And they're not a lot of cultural references, but if you would use that for literature, I think that text would be more bland and less creative and.	
19:43.3 - 19:50.2	R4NL: yeah I think that would have a serious impact actually on the enjoyment of especially literary tax.	
19:52.9 - 19:56.0	Interviewer: Enjoyment of translations as well right?	
19:56.2 - 20:05.2	Interviewer: Right so and I wanted to ask you, because the title was translated into Catalan.	
20:08.5 - 20:08.8	Interviewer: yeah.	
20:10.4 - 20:18.0	Interviewer: and it wasn't translated into Dutch so the reference to be or not to be was left there.	
20:19.1 - 20:21.0	Interviewer: And what do you think about that.	
20:22.3 - 20:26.7	R4NL: I think that it would work in a Dutch text, but you would need like some.	
20:28.7 - 20:37.3	R4NL: You need to add something to make it work, I think I also said that in my editing like, then you have to say that you pronounce it.	
20:38.2 - 20:46.6	R4NL: In the English way, because if you only read it and read it, we just read it, they wouldn't know that you have to pronounce it the  English way and then wordplay would be lost.	
20:47.7 - 20:48.4	R4NL: So I think.	
20:49.0 - 20:51.5	Interviewer: But then it is explained in the text right.	
20:53.7 - 21:01.1	R4NL: Oh, I think there's like this part in a text where where it says like it pronounced the the zero as naught.	
21:02.7 - 21:06.0	R4NL: I think if you put like a sentence there they pronounced the number.	
21:07.1 - 21:08.0	R4NL: in English.	
21:10.7 - 21:23.1	R4NL: And pronouncing zero as naught, I think that will be enough, because I think that to be or not to be is famous enough in Dutch and pretty much all Dutch people know know that quote English.	
21:23.2 - 21:24.5	Interviewer: In English? Right.	
21:24.6 - 21:32.3	Interviewer: So so so you don't have the same in in Dutch, when people are using it, because it's a it's a sentence.	
21:33.3 - 21:44.3	Interviewer: That has transcended the play in the way that some people have never read the play or seen the play, but they say to be or not to be that's the question... Do you think that	
21:44.8 - 21:51.3	Interviewer: In Dutch people will you know it in English or in	
21:51.3 - 21:52.3	R4NL: I think, maybe they even know it better in English, than in Dutch.	
21:52.3 - 21:55.7	Interviewer: What is it in Dutch? Zijn of...	
21:56.1 - 21:57.5	R4NL: "Zijn of niet te zijn".	
21:58.2 - 22:01.2	Interviewer: "Of niet te zijn", but people would find that odd.	
22:01.6 - 22:02.0	R4NL: yeah.	
22:03.7 - 22:13.4	R4NL: I mean, I believe that is also like the official translation, there are multiple official translations, obviously, but I think you usually translated something like that.	
22:14.0 - 22:25.0	R4NL: "zijn of niet zijn", "zijn of niet te zijn" , but I think, to be or not to be even in English is better known in Holland, than.	
22:25.1 - 22:27.4	R4NL: yeah the Dutch translation.	
22:29.0 - 22:39.0	Interviewer: And this is another curious thing about translation, which wouldn't be acceptable in Catalan of course because.	
22:39.5 - 22:56.2	Interviewer: Some people might know to be or not to be but it wouldn't be a given at all right, but everybody knows the Catalan or the Spanish equivalent in, even if they don't know, but then the actual play they know the phrase.	
22:56.2 - 22:57.7	R4NL: expression yeah yeah.	
22:58.4 - 22:59.8	Interviewer: So that's interesting.	
23:00.2 - 23:03.7	R4NL: And maybe like because Spain is a subtitling.	
23:04.0 - 23:06.6	R4NL: No? it's like a dubbing country not subtitling right.	
23:07.4 - 23:12.2	Interviewer: But i'm not only talking about Spain and even talking about South America here right.	
23:12.6 - 23:15.4	Interviewer: We are we are subtitling, and we are...	
23:15.4 - 23:20.6	Interviewer: Right yeah but in Argentina i'm originally from Argentina, if...	
23:21.9 - 23:39.9	Interviewer: I am not saying nobody will understand to be or not to be, but this sentence that we all say is "ser o no ser" is like "esa es la cuestiÃ³n" it is like a set phrase you know, and this has come from from old times since the, because the translation has been going around forever.	
23:40.3 - 23:52.4	Interviewer: So so for us as translators either Catalan or Spanish, it will be an under translation, it will be an error not to try and do something with this.	
23:53.0 - 23:55.6	R4NL: Right that's interesting I think that's a different.	
23:55.8 - 24:04.8	R4NL: With the with the Dutch language I think here we, we also think, maybe we appreciate it like we think it sounds cool or something like that.	
24:04.9 - 24:06.5	R4NL: We, like the way.	
24:06.9 - 24:11.4	R4NL: That these English expression sound and so we are used to them, I guess.	
24:11.7 - 24:24.7	Interviewer: And this is also an interesting I mean I obviously suspected it this because, obviously, the level of English in the Netherlands, and even if you watch a movie there are English words in them.	
24:27.0 - 24:30.1	Interviewer: And I watched some series with subtitles in Dutch.	
24:31.4 - 24:44.5	Interviewer: And the cool words like you say it in English, just one so it's something that I suspected but that's why I asked, because I wanted to make sure that everyone felt the same, that it was in fact better to leave it like that right.	
24:45.9 - 24:46.8	Interviewer: mmm	
24:47.8 - 24:49.4	Interviewer: If you were to.	
24:51.1 - 24:53.0	Interviewer: If you had a magic wand.	
24:55.6 - 24:59.4	Interviewer: And you weren't to ask for em.	
25:01.2 - 25:04.2	Interviewer: Technology or machine translation to.	
25:06.2 - 25:09.4	Interviewer: It could be machine translation, but it could be technology in general.	
25:11.2 - 25:19.9	Interviewer: What would you ask to have as a literary translator. What would you like to see in technology or to.	
25:22.2 - 25:26.6	Interviewer: To see what development would you like to see, would be helpful for you.	
25:27.7 - 25:30.8	Interviewer: Maybe nothing but, just in case you had a magic one.	
25:31.4 - 25:41.9	R4NL: Well, no, I think I think machine translation could be very helpful, but it would need to be for literary translation, it would need to be a lot more creative.	
25:42.8 - 25:49.6	R4NL: Oh, not not as literal as it is now because right now machine translation is often very literal translation.	
25:50.4 - 25:55.6	R4NL: And it would have to take into account style, I think that is the most important.	
25:56.3 - 26:09.8	R4NL: Factor that is right now is missing in in machine translations there's no real attention to style maybe like maybe there's sometimes a difference between formal and informal but that's about it, I think, right now.	
26:11.2 - 26:32.6	R4NL: So, for it to be really helpful for me as a as a literary translator and to actually help me at entire sentences, I can use from machine translation, it would have to take those things into account for it to be able to help me but yeah i'm not sure if I would want that.	
26:33.1 - 26:33.9	Interviewer: Why not?	
26:34.3 - 26:49.5	R4NL: Because I would take the fun out of it, I guess that's part of what makes it such a great job as literary trasnlator, is that creativity and that's what I like about these texts and if the machine can do it, then I am just the editor.	
26:51.2 - 26:58.6	R4NL: So i'm not sure if I would want that, for an entire text, it would be maybe helpful if we come up with lots of synonyms.	
27:00.2 - 27:04.4	R4NL: Maybe, more so than than it does now bit more creative creatively.	
27:04.7 - 27:05.1	Interviewer: If it	
27:05.1 - 27:06.4	Interviewer: gave you options?	
27:06.5 - 27:10.6	R4NL: yeah it would give me different options that I could choose from where i'm stuck.	
27:11.7 - 27:14.0	R4NL: But only then... like not before.	
27:14.2 - 27:16.0	Interviewer: yeah you can you can ask.	
27:16.0 - 27:16.6	Interviewer: For it.	
27:17.0 - 27:18.8	R4NL: right if I if I needed.	
27:19.8 - 27:23.9	R4NL: That would that might be something but yeah I don't think I would want.	
27:25.0 - 27:29.5	R4NL: To have a machine translation take over the whole translation process.	
27:29.8 - 27:36.0	Interviewer: So let's imagine that this engine i'm going very sci-fi here...	
27:38.6 - 27:42.0	Interviewer: produces this perfectly correct sentences.	
27:45.4 - 27:51.6	Interviewer: Do you think it would be different than a translator than a human translator translating.	
27:53.0 - 28:01.1	R4NL: Or do you mean like perfectly correct in the sense of just the meaning or perfectly correct, also in the sense of style.	
28:01.1 - 28:01.6	Interviewer: Yes.	
28:01.7 - 28:05.1	Interviewer: Also in the style, the style and the meaning.	
28:05.9 - 28:06.9	R4NL: um.	
28:08.6 - 28:26.1	R4NL: yeah maybe if that were the case, machine translation might be a bit more objective because, like a human translator always has his or her own preferences and his or her own style as well, that is added to the translation.	
28:27.2 - 28:35.4	R4NL: And you might not have that as much with machine translation, so it might it might like if we're talking really SCI fi.	
28:36.0 - 28:37.1	Interviewer: We are going really si-fi.	
28:38.8 - 28:41.0	R4NL: I wouldn't might even make it easier to.	
28:42.3 - 28:46.0	R4NL: also get like the style of the original author across.	
28:47.1 - 28:56.4	R4NL: Because, then they won't there wouldn't be any interference from the style of the translator you would have to the style of the original author and then.	
28:57.9 - 29:00.7	R4NL: As for that more objectively.	
29:02.2 - 29:02.6	R4NL: Maybe.	
29:03.0 - 29:05.5	Interviewer: Maybe yeah yeah I like your.	
29:06.7 - 29:12.4	Interviewer: Would would readers like this that the translators' personalities is gone.	
29:13.0 - 29:16.1	R4NL: And I think readers right now don't really notice that.	
29:17.3 - 29:31.6	R4NL: Don't really notice the influence of have a translator right now so i'm not sure if they would notice if it were just if a machine translation would be like fluent and natural and like stylistically correct as well i'm not sure that they would notice.	
29:33.1 - 29:35.7	R4NL: If the translator was not there anymore.	
29:38.0 - 29:41.9	R4NL: Because most readers when they read the translation now they don't even think about it.	
29:43.4 - 29:46.2	R4NL: They just think Oh, this is the style of the original author.	
29:48.8 - 29:59.6	Interviewer: yeah do you think machine translation can contribute to the translation of certain and pair of languages?	
30:01.4 - 30:20.6	Interviewer: That at the moment there aren't and nobody's interested in translating, for example, i'm making this up... Romanian Dutch do you think machine translation could help in this strange language combinations to to make an author best known in a country.	
30:21.8 - 30:31.2	R4NL: Well, if you were like like you say if it were able to produce like a correct translation also stylistically then yeah sure, I think, then I would be.	
30:31.6 - 30:33.0	Interviewer: And if it had errors?	
30:35.0 - 30:41.8	R4NL: hmm well, that would make it more difficult because if there were no specialists in the country to correct.	
30:43.0 - 30:47.5	R4NL: These errors would go unnoticed, so I think.	
30:49.3 - 30:57.4	R4NL: It kind of depends on how many errors, it makes maybe like like if it's just a few small errors that maybe wouldn't would like.	
30:58.6 - 31:01.9	R4NL: Outweigh like that you're at least bringing that book.	
31:02.1 - 31:04.5	R4NL: readers who would otherwise not have read it at all.	
31:05.0 - 31:08.9	R4NL: So I kind of depends on how good it is if it's okay.	
31:10.0 - 31:10.7	R4NL: Maybe it's better.	
31:10.9 - 31:21.4	Interviewer: Yeah it's like this fun subs you know in movies, that they have the subtitles being done by a machine or or.	
31:22.6 - 31:30.3	Interviewer: or or by fans that are not professional translators and people see the series, and nobody complains.	
31:32.1 - 31:32.6	R4NL: yeah.	
31:34.1 - 31:40.2	Interviewer: What do you think about that? Do you think think this could happen in in in in the literary world as well.	
31:42.2 - 31:52.1	R4NL: yeah it might be, it might be a possibility, maybe like publishers are like it's better to at least have it published in other languages than to not have it published out there at all.	
31:53.8 - 32:02.0	R4NL: Maybe that's what like if if if it's an important book for their culture, it would think it's better to have something than nothing.	
32:04.0 - 32:06.0	R4NL: I could imagine that some.	
32:08.0 - 32:10.4	R4NL: publisher would think that that will work that way.	
32:11.6 - 32:13.9	Interviewer: What do you think the author will think.	
32:17.4 - 32:20.4	R4NL: That is a good question um.	
32:22.2 - 32:30.5	R4NL: i'm not sure if if i'm trying to think like, if I were the author, what would, I think i'm not sure if I would be very happy with that because, maybe.	
32:32.3 - 32:36.8	R4NL: I wouldn't be sure if it will get my message across, in the way I would want it to get across.	
32:37.9 - 32:41.5	R4NL: i'm not sure if I would be happy with that.	
32:42.5 - 32:43.2	R4NL: Probably.	
32:44.2 - 32:45.5	R4NL: I would be quite worried.	
32:47.0 - 32:53.8	R4NL: What what it what it would be like, especially because I won't be able to check it of course because i'm assuming it will be language that I wouldn't know.	
32:55.6 - 32:57.6	R4NL: I would be worried if it were.	
32:59.0 - 33:02.6	R4NL: still getting cross matches I would want or if it had changed anything.	
33:03.4 - 33:04.1	Interviewer: mm hmm.	
33:05.2 - 33:05.8	Interviewer: and	
33:06.7 - 33:08.9	Interviewer: One of the reviewers in the Dutch.	
33:09.8 - 33:20.9	Interviewer: team mentioned that these three translations were very, very bad and that none of them were up to standard and that	
33:22.3 - 33:29.5	Interviewer: They were not done by professional translators, etc, etc, so I have asked the other reviewers.	
33:31.4 - 33:37.3	Interviewer: What their opinion was about the three if they really felt the three words so substandard.	
33:40.4 - 33:41.8	Interviewer: What is your opinion?	
33:42.8 - 33:53.7	R4NL: Well, I wouldn't say like it was terrible they were all horrible I wouldn't agree with that, I would think that um.	
33:56.2 - 34:05.4	R4NL: That maybe it was done by someone who did not have a whole lot of experience with some experience, but maybe not many years of experience.	
34:07.4 - 34:25.6	R4NL: I will yeah like like I said, if I would correct just text C without having seen the other texts I would probably be have been a bit more strict and would still have quite a few editorial notes, before I would have that translation published.	
34:27.1 - 34:35.8	R4NL: So in that respect I I can understand why one of the other reviewers would say that they were below standard.	
34:36.8 - 34:37.4	R4NL: yeah.	
34:38.7 - 34:47.2	R4NL: Maybe yeah maybe a little maybe there were a bit more errors than I would have expected, but I wouldn't say that it was um unpublishable.	
34:47.6 - 34:48.1	Interviewer: Okay. Of course B, yes	
34:51.8 - 34:53.0	R4NL: Yes, yes right.	
34:53.0 - 34:53.9	R4NL: You mentioned as.	
34:54.7 - 35:00.8	R4NL: Well, A I wouldn't i'm not sure if I would publish A either actually because.	
35:02.3 - 35:07.6	R4NL: yeah I think it would be a bit lacking in style particularly.	
35:09.4 - 35:20.8	R4NL: I don't think I would publish either A or B, but C with editing I think would be able to get up to that level of being suitable for for publishing.	
35:21.6 - 35:22.0	Interviewer: mm hmm.	
35:23.1 - 35:23.9	R4NL: I think yeah.	
35:24.0 - 35:25.0	Interviewer: yeah, of course.	
35:26.0 - 35:31.2	Interviewer: Is there any other comments that you would like to make about the.	
35:33.4 - 35:42.3	Interviewer: The tasks, machine translation, translation, literary translation, something that you feel you want to share with us.	
35:44.0 - 35:44.8	R4NL: um.	
35:46.3 - 35:59.2	R4NL: Well yeah well I already said this, I think, like, I know, just like when I thought back about it when I was finished, that I was heavily influenced by the first two when I did, like the third so like there's a lot of interference.	
35:59.5 - 36:02.5	R4NL: Because you're checking the same text three times.	
36:03.4 - 36:09.1	R4NL: So yeah that definitely influences the way you look at the other ones.	
36:10.3 - 36:15.2	R4NL: i'm not sure how that relates to your research question is what was your.	
36:15.3 - 36:27.2	Interviewer: Something has to give because if you do it the other way around, if you start with C then it may influence the other two, so no matter how you do it.	
36:29.0 - 36:34.4	R4NL: For B and, if you will take three different texts and like and weren't.	
36:34.4 - 36:37.5	Interviewer: Then you cannot compare them because they are different texts.	
36:37.6 - 36:39.3	Interviewer: Different creativity.	
36:40.0 - 36:41.1	Interviewer: A.	
36:43.4 - 36:46.1	Interviewer: Even different translators a.	
36:46.3 - 36:50.7	R4NL: yeah yeah that there's always every translator translates in a different way.	
36:51.3 - 36:56.2	Interviewer: So, so the only way to do it and.	
36:57.3 - 37:02.9	Interviewer: The other thing could be to do things out of context so paragraphs.	
37:04.1 - 37:04.4	Interviewer: Right.	
37:05.3 - 37:08.2	R4NL: yeah i'm not sure if that will work with literary texts, because the text is so interconnected.	
37:08.6 - 37:24.7	Interviewer: And also, but even if it was short, very very short stories, then the second part of the research is on engagement of the readers So then, if you don't have a.	
37:26.6 - 37:30.9	Interviewer: sort of the story to read or so short as.	
37:31.4 - 37:33.7	Interviewer: How can I measure an engagement right.	
37:33.9 - 37:53.6	Interviewer: Right, so there are many constraints in research, I wanted to ask you, since you brought this up, what did you think of classifying the creative shifts What did you think of the units that were selected and what did you think of classifying these creative shifts and reproductions.	
37:56.7 - 38:04.3	R4NL: Well, I think that was also like with the acceptability, sometimes I got the feeling that it was hard to.	
38:05.3 - 38:12.9	R4NL: limit my comments into one category like sometimes I was like oh it's kind of in between something or like.	
38:14.3 - 38:16.9	R4NL: So yeah that that made it hard, because you had to choose.	
38:18.2 - 38:21.8	R4NL: So, like I did I did try to specify by putting in a comment.	
38:23.2 - 38:30.2	R4NL: But yeah that that was, I think the hardest part put it into one specific category when you would rather just.	
38:31.3 - 38:37.0	R4NL: elaborate and explain exactly why you thought it was not good or yeah.	
38:37.6 - 38:43.9	Interviewer: But did it make you see creativity in a different way to note these creative shifts?	
38:46.1 - 38:50.4	R4NL: Well, I think it made me more aware, maybe you have how many times.	
38:51.7 - 39:01.2	R4NL: You are causing a creative shift as a literary translator because normally when I translate I don't really think about all the shifts.	
39:01.6 - 39:02.4	R4NL: That occurred.	
39:02.8 - 39:10.3	R4NL: I think it made me more aware of, especially compared to a more literal translation, like the machine translation.	
39:10.8 - 39:19.3	R4NL: It made me more aware of how important creativity is and how big a part it plays in in literary translationtion I guess.	
39:21.0 - 39:21.4	Interviewer: yeah.	
39:22.4 - 39:25.6	Interviewer: that's interesting and.	
39:28.1 - 39:31.5	Interviewer: I think this is also the novelty of the.	
39:33.0 - 39:41.6	Interviewer: Of this analysis that we work that you did, together with me or, together with the whole team.	
39:43.2 - 40:06.9	Interviewer: Is that it's not very often that we see that kind of analysis, sometimes we only see error so or or reception of the text, but not so much how many times, these translators chose to use something different that wasn't a very literal translation right.	
40:08.0 - 40:15.9	R4NL: Right yeah I think usually it's just very intuitive because we think about that, when you're doing it as a translator.	
40:16.9 - 40:18.1	R4NL: But then they think see.	
40:18.3 - 40:26.2	Interviewer: This text has had a lot of units of creative potential, so this text was chosen.	
40:26.2 - 40:29.8	Interviewer: deliberately because he had to make you think.	
40:30.6 - 40:36.5	Interviewer: and other text, I think, allow for a more standard a.	
40:37.6 - 40:42.0	Interviewer: equivalence is you know what I mean, even in literary texts.	
40:42.2 - 40:47.0	R4NL: Sure there's a lot of there's big differences in how creative, you need to be.	
40:47.0 - 40:50.3	Interviewer: Exactly and also sometimes it's the story the driver.	
40:54.3 - 40:58.5	Interviewer: The story keeps moving and being interesting.	
40:58.7 - 41:01.3	R4NL: Sometimes the plot is more important than style that's.	
41:01.3 - 41:02.3	R4NL: Definitely true yeah.	
41:04.1 - 41:05.2	Interviewer: Anything else.	
41:08.4 - 41:17.0	R4NL: Well, I was wondering how many people worked on this much part of the study like how many so you said there were two translators.	
41:17.3 - 41:19.5	Interviewer: To translators and three reviewers, so five.	
41:19.6 - 41:20.9	R4NL: So you know.	
41:22.4 - 41:23.8	Interviewer: And five Catalans.	
41:24.0 - 41:32.5	R4NL: And, like the other i'm curious what were the other reviewers reactions to these three texts like where.	
41:32.6 - 41:35.8	Interviewer: The same as you... the same as you.	
41:37.2 - 41:37.7	R4NL: interesting.	
41:38.8 - 41:41.8	Interviewer: In the two languages.	
41:43.4 - 41:46.8	R4NL: Cause you did the Catalan and the Dutch, are you going to do any other language or.	
41:46.9 - 41:47.2	Interviewer: I don't.	
41:51.4 - 41:52.2	R4NL: No, I guess.	
41:54.1 - 42:01.5	Interviewer: I know so and i'm going to stop the recording and then I tell you I do a debriefing a proper debreafing.
