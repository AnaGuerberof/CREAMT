Most of the things I changed were necessary when one takes a whole-text approach and wants to ensure consistency and internal connections, but there were a lot of things that were perfectly usable. I particularly didn't like the fact that it kept offering different translations of the same word (""orderly""), which was confusing at first. ",,17
