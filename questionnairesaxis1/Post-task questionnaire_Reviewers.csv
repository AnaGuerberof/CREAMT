It can be effortlessly read, and then such translation problems as the wordplay in the title, the rhyme scheme in the poem and the various names by which the institution mentioned is known (""Automat"" and so on) are satisfactorily or even brilliantly solved. However, other problems are not. The main one is probably ""you"", whose Catalan translation must be modulated on the basis of the degree of familiarity in a relationship. There are also a number of mistranslations and instances of calque.",Extremely bad,"Almost all sentences need some kind of correction, whether it is minor changes or major adjustments having to do with meaning and/or idiomaticity. There is a large number of calques, and quite a few words and expressions are left untranslated. Notable among the latter are the various names that the institution officially known as ""Ethical Suicide Studio"" goes by. The rhyme scheme in the poem is not re-created, and nor is the wordplay on ""2 B R 0 2 B"". (In)formality in the relationships signalled by you is not adequately relayed either. Literal translation is the norm, whether it works or not.",Extremely good,"Text C is a publishable translation. Most issues mentioned for texts A and B are satisfactorily solved: idiomaticity, wordplay, (in)formality in modes of address... The names for the ""Ethical Suicide Studio"" are in general brilliantly relayed. And translating ""Duncan"" as ""Pelham"" on the basis of the wordplay between ""Duncan"" and ""dunk"" is a wonderful solution that bespeaks a very creative translator. On the other hand, there are some mistranslations and the rhyme scheme is not re-created, but these shortcomings taken together do not lessen the general merit of the translation, in my opinion.",2,3,1,,5,1,7

I found it problematic that they did not solve the pun with the title, which I think is fundamental in the text. The pun with Leora Duncan was not solved either.",Extremely bad,"Well, as we discussed in the interview, this text was so creative and such in need for a creative translation that the machine result was very very poor. None of the wordgames were solved, there were plenty of stylistic, coherence, cohesion, and lexical errors, and also many meaning issues. ",Extremely good,"The translators managed to solve the wordgames, the problems posed by orality and made a beautiful translation. I was not seeing English behind at every turn and the proposed neologisms were great!",3,2,1,,5,1,7

Especially CSI's, the metrum of the song, thematic (esp. army) references are not well rendered. Dialogues are slightly off too.

Basic translation mechanisms are relatively well employed, though. Some mistakes in interpretation.",Extremely bad,"Obviously translated by a machine with no real-world experience and no interpreting skills: some solutions are completely out of place in the context, very often the wrong interpretation of words is chosen. Still, not bad for a machine! Just not very pleasant reading and the gist of the text completely disappears.",Extremely good,"This is a very good, creative translation, except for the silly rendering of 'drupelet', which makes no sense. Other than that, the dialogues sound more colloquial than in the original, perhaps unnecessarily so, but a good translator is entitled to his 'signature'.

So perhaps a 'very good' rather than 'extremely good' translation, but the gist and tone of the text and the personality of the characters have been conserved.",2,3,1,,3,1,7
